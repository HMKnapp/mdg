=== Fields

[#API_PaybyBankapp_Fields_debit_withPC]
==== _debit_ with PayConnect

This is faster checkout option without typing the unique 6-digit PBBA
code to a mobile banking app. To support the PayConnect feature for
Consumer desktop, laptop or tablet based payment journeys, the consumer
has an option to link the browser he/she is using to a Mobile Banking
App after a successful payment on the device which results in a
PayConnect cookie being stored in the consumer's browser if consent is
given.

.How it works

. Once the consumer has authorised an ECOM Transaction using a PBBA
code the Consumer is given the option to enable PayConnect, which links
the browser they are using to their mobile banking app. +
image:images/11-20-paybybankapp/ui_payconnect.png[PayConnect, height=250]
. On subsequent _PBBA_ transactions from the same browser the Consumer
will receive a Push Notification on their linked Mobile device and upon
action they automatically invoke their MBA.
. The transaction is retrieved by the consumer's financial institution
after the Consumer swipes the Push Notification and logs in to their
MBA.

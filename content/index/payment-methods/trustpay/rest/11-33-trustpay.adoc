[#TrustPay_DirectBankingExtension]
==== Direct Banking Extension

[#TrustPay_DirectBankingExtension_Introduction]
===== Introduction

The _Direct Online Banking_ feature of _TrustPay_'s merchant API allows
the merchant to display bank payment options directly on the website,
providing a fully customizable solution. By integrating the direct
banking functionality, *the consumer does not have to be redirected to the*
*_TrustPay_* *site to choose a bank*. In case of online payments, the
consumer is instead *redirected directly to the bank* selected on
merchant's site.

[#TrustPay_DirectBankingExtension_Workflow]
===== Workflow

image::images/11-33-trustpay/TrustPay_directbankingextension_workflow.png[TrustPay Direct Banking Extension workflow.png]

This workflow is almost identical to <<TrustPay_debitTransaction, _debit_ Transaction>>, except that the consumer doesn't need to select a bank.

[#TrustPay_DirectBankingExtension_Fields]
===== Fields

The following elements are used for sending a request for the direct
banking extension for _TrustPay._

[cols="e,,,,"]
|===
| Fieldname | Cardinality | Datatype | Size | Description

| account-holder.address.country | O | Alphanumeric | 2 |Country identifier of a payer.
| custom-fields.custom-field@name="gwkey" | M | Alphanumeric | 256 | Dynamic gateway key of a bank to be returned.
| success-redirect-url | M |Alphanumeric | 256 |The redirect URL for successful payments.
| fail-redirect-url | M | Alphanumeric | 256 | The redirect URL for failed payments.
|===

[#TrustPay_DirectBankingExtension_Samples]
===== Samples

Look for samples with <<TrustPay_Samples_SelectedGatewayTestPaySK, Selected Gateway of "TestPaySK">>.

[#TrustPay_OfflinePayment]
==== Offline Payment

Due to the fact the _TrustPay_ offers offline payments, Wirecard has
introduced a _pending-debit_ transaction type for this method. The
reason is that some banks don't settle payments during weekends and
public holidays so waiting time for a notification from the bank may
take several days.

The _pending-debit_ transaction helps the merchant to confirm the
consumer's payment close to the payment process.

The General payments sequence is:

. ``get-url``
. ``pending-debit``
. ``debit``

//-

The following scenarios are covered:

[#TrustPay_OfflinePayment_SuccessfulWorkflow]
===== Successful Workflow

image::images/11-33-trustpay/TrustPay_workflow_pending_debit_debit_success.png[TrustPay workflow for pending debit and debit]

. The consumer initiates a payment.
. TrustPay redirects the consumer to the merchant and sends a
notification to the merchant.
. If the merchant receives the notification prior to the redirect of
the consumer:
.. The merchant forwards the notification to _{payment-gateway-abbr}_.
.. {payment-gateway-abbr} creates a _debit_ transaction and a _pending-debit_ transaction.
.. {payment-gateway-abbr} writes both transactions to the DB.
.. {payment-gateway-abbr} sends a _debit_ response to the merchant.
.. The merchant redirects the consumer to the successful TrustPay page
. If the merchant receives the redirect of the consumer prior to the
notification:
.. The merchant creates a _pending-debit_ transaction.
.. The merchant sends the _pending-debit_ transaction to _{payment-gateway-abbr}_.
.. The merchant redirects the consumer to the successful TrustPay page.
.. {payment-gateway-abbr} sends the _debit_ response to the merchant.

//-

[#TrustPay_OfflinePayment_FailureWorkflow]
===== Failure Workflow

In case of failure the merchant creates a failed _pending-debit_. _{payment-gateway-abbr}_
doesn't create a _debit_ and the merchant redirects the consumer to the
failure page.

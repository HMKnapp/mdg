=== Transactions

[#MoipPagamentos_Transactions_Configuring]
==== Configuring Your Account for _moip_

The merchant account you want to use for BRL transactions has to be
configured for _moip_ specifically, otherwise it will not be able to
process them. At the moment, merchant accounts configured for _moip_
cannot use any other providers.

NOTE: If you want to process transactions from multiple providers, you will
need additional merchant accounts for those.

[#MoipPagamentos_Transactions_ProcessingTransaction]
==== Processing a Transaction

After your account is configured for _moip_, you only need to send a
regular payment request to {payment-gateway} and the rest of
the transaction is processed automatically by {payment-gateway}.

Due to security requirements, all payments are registered as pending. It
can take up to 48 hours before the pending status is processed and
cleared.

[#MoipPagamentos_TestCredentials_CreateAccount]

NOTE: This is currently done by the _moip_ team.

Having a Classical _moip_ Account means that the owner of that account
can manage its sales in the _moip_ environment. _moip_ offers two types
of accounts, allowing any marketplace or platform to create two
different onboarding experiences, they are: Transparent _moip_ Account
and Classical _moip_ Account.

[#paydirekt_ExpressCheckout_Description]
===== Description

_paydirekt_ Express enables payments to be made, with the shipping
address being returned to the merchant. In this way, a purchase can be
made without consumers having to enter their address on the merchant
website or having to create a consumer account. To complete the payment
and conclusively confirm it, the execute link must be called up after
the consumer confirmation in the _paydirekt_ system. Here, the
consumer is typically redirected back to the shop and prompted to
confirm the merchant's general terms & conditions of business.

[#paydirekt_ExpressCheckout_Configuration]
===== Configuration

WARNING: There is no special flag to mark "Express" Checkout, this depends on
merchant's configuration.

[#paydirekt_ProcessFlow]
===== Process Flow

. Consumer: Clicks _EXPRESS Checkout_ Button in the Shop.
. Shop-System: Calls the checkout endpoint and submits all relevant
order data to _paydirekt._ +
_paydirekt:_ Returns the _approve_" link (_paydirekt_ payment page) in
the API Response.
. Shop-System: Redirects the Consumer to the approve link (_paydirekt_
payment page).
. Consumer: Logs into his _paydirekt_ account on the _paydirekt_
payment page.
. _paydirekt_: Calls the shop-system's ``callbackUrlCheckDestinations``
endpoint (the shop-system must provide this callback) after the consumer
logs in and the shop-system provides all addresses available in the
consumer's _paydirekt_ account in that call. +
Shop-System: Uses the addresses submitted from _paydirekt_ and decides
which addresses are allowed as invoice and/or delivery address.
Furthermore the shop system needs to add the shipping options for each
address and return this in the answer to the callback call.
. _paydirekt_: Displays the default addresses on the payment
page (those addresses used most often by the consumer) along with the
shipping options (that _paydirekt_ received in step 5). +
. Consumer: Chooses one of the shipping addresses. Alternatively, the
consumer can choose any other address available in his/her _paydirekt_
account (they all have shipping options associated due to the callback).
The consumer may also add a new address. If the consumer adds a new
address, a callback is issued similar to step 5, sending the new address
to the merchant. Handling is the same as in step 5. +
_paydirekt_: While the consumer chooses a shipping option on the payment
page, Wirecard recalculates/updates the totalAmount in the shopping
cart.
. Consumer: Consumer clicks on the _Jetzt kaufen_ link on the payment
page.
. _paydirekt_: Redirects the user back to the shop (using the provided
redirect URLS) depending on the status of the Directsale/Order
actions.
. Shop-System: Queries (GET) the checkout. The checkout now contains
the addresses the consumer selected along with the shipping options. The
shop-system now has all relevant data.
. Shop-System: Shows the _Final Order_ screen and _Order Confirmation_
button (along with the data from step 10).
. Consumer: Clicks the _Order Confirmation_ button
. Shop-System: Internally flags/stores the order as _confirmed_ AND
sends the execute request to _paydirekt_ (for initiating all payment
processes = getting the money). +
_paydirekt_: Will return the status of the execute call.
. Shop-System: Depending on the Status of Step 13:
.. Show the "thank you page" and stores the payment information to the
order. Or
.. In case of an error, most likely presents the consumer with a page
to choose a different payment method.

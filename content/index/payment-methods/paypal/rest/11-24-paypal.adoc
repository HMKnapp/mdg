[#API_PaymentMethods_PayPal]
== REST API & {payment-page-v1}
_PayPal_ is a type of <<PaymentMethods_PaymentMode_Wallet, Wallet>>.

[#API_PayPal_Express]
=== _PayPal_ Express Checkout
Consumers can make purchases without entering billing, shipping,
and credit card information as all of this information is already stored
with _PayPal_. Also, the consumer is able to change the shipping
address during the checkout in _PayPal_. Therefore the shipping address
together with other payment details are returned to your web shop
for further processing.

proper functionality, an <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN_Configuration, IPN configuration>> is required in the merchant's _PayPal_ account. This
transaction type will occur only for transactions in review process and
is not invoked for all transactions automatically. |

[#API_PayPal_Transactions_Recurring]
==== Recurring Transaction

IMPORTANT: The endpoint for referenced transactions is: ``\https://{instance-hostname}/engine/rest/payments/``.

The {payment-gateway} allows a merchant to submit
<<GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions_Recurring, recurring transactions>>
for _PayPal_ transactions. To submit a recurring transaction, the merchant
must submit a request with the transaction type _Debit_, _Authorization_ or
_Authorization-Only_ including a
<<GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions_Recurring_Periodic, PERIODIC TYPE>>
and a <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions_Recurring_Sequence, SEQUENCE TYPE>> element.
With _PayPal_ it is also possible to mix the transaction types
_Authorization_ and _Debit_.

Read, which <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions_Recurring_Restrictions, restrictions>>
have to be met to use a recurring transaction.

[#API_PayPal_Transactions_TransactionTypes_PayPalSpecific]
==== _PayPal_-Specific Use of Transaction Types

[#API_PayPal_Transactions_TransactionTypes_PayPalSpecific_preauthorization]
===== _preauthorization_

It is possible to obtain consumer's preliminary payment confirmation
(along with shipping details from _PayPal_, for example) without
reserving funds on payer's _PayPal_ account. This can be achieved
using a _preauthorization_ transaction, which have the same parameters
as _authorization_ or _debit_ request. Similarly, the _Forward-URL_ to
the <<API_PayPal_Express, _PayPal_ Express Checkout>> is
delivered in the response, where the consumer needs to confirm the
payment. In order to finalize the payment, a regular _authorization_ or
_debit_ transaction needs to be submitted, referencing the prior
_preauthorization_ transaction using the _Parent-transaction-ID_ field.
The _preauthorization_ does not need to be canceled if the merchant
decides not to follow up on this order attempt.

[#API_PayPal_Transactions_TransactionTypes_PayPalSpecific_authorizationOnly]
===== _authorization-only_

On _PayPal_ merchant setup site the option "Use <<API_PayPal_Express, Express Checkout>> to
process payments" must be "true", otherwise it is not possible to create a "get-url" transaction.
_authorization-only_ (records data at _PayPal_ and Wirecard for later
payments/recurring transactions) requires the following:

- Additional activation of the setting "Obtain authorization for
pre-approved payments and initiate pre-approved transactions."
- _authorization-only_ transaction needs the following settings:
* address the ``...paymentmethods`` endpoint
.  the <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions_Recurring_Periodic, periodic type>> part must be either "recurring" or "installment"
.  the <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_Transactions_Recurring_Sequence, sequence type>> must be "first".
* amount = ``0.00``
- In addition the merchant can reference ``authorization-only`` by either
``debit`` or ``authorization``. A Follow-up authorization can be then be
captured.
* address the ``â€¦/payments`` endpoint for the follow-up debit
* always use non-zero amount for debit operation
* the correct (parent-)transaction-id is visible as
group-transaction-id in _{enterprise-portal-url}_ for example or can be found out by querying
{payment-gateway} using the RequestID from the initial
transaction (see
<<GeneralPlatformFeatures_RetrieveTransaction_RequestID, here>>).
//-

[#API_PayPal_Transactions_TransactionTypes_PayPalSpecific_credit]
===== _credit_

_credit_ transaction moves funds from the merchant to the consumer
without referencing previous payment. It's a fast and convenient way to
send commissions, rebates, rewards, and general payments.

_PayPal_ takes the payment amounts from your account and attempts to put
them into the recipients' _PayPal_ account. If the recipients do not
have _PayPal_ accounts, _PayPal_ notifies them that a payment is
available and they must create a _PayPal_ account to receive the
payment. _PayPal_ will temporarily hold the total monetary value of the
mass payment, plus associated fees, until processing is completed. If a
payment is sent to a recipient who does not have a _PayPal_ account, and
it remains unclaimed for 30 days from the payment date, the money is
returned to your _PayPal_ account.

Every recipient receives an email notifying them of the payment.
Recipients with a _PayPal_ click a link in the email message, log in to
their account, and access their payments. If the recipients do not have
a _PayPal_ account, their email message contains a link that directs
them to a _PayPal_ sign-up page. The sign-up process automatically
confirms their email address. When they complete the sign-up process,
the money is available in their new _PayPal_ account. Customers will
then have the option to make online purchases with their money, withdraw
it to a bank account, have a check mailed to them, or request for
_PayPal_ to send them a debit card to access their funds.

Merchant needs to specify one (or multiple) of three fields in the
_pending-credit_ request:

- ``wallet.account-id`` (with customer's _PayPal_ account identifier)
- ``account-holder.email``
- ``account-holder.phone``

The provided information is used in this order to identify the recipient
of the payment. As soon as request is submitted a _pending-credit_
transaction is created in the database. Once Wirecard has received a
notification from _PayPal_ about the final status, a follow-up _credit_
transaction is created, and this status will be communicated to the
merchant via the _Notification-URL_ that is configured in the merchant
account. If no _Notification-URL_ is configured in the merchant account
the notification will be sent via email to the merchant in case the
email address has been configured.

_credit_ transaction is provided over so-called "Mass Payments" service,
so merchant should contact _PayPal_ Customer Support to enable Mass
Payments for their _PayPal_ premier or business accounts.

[#API_PayPal_Transactions_TransactionTypes_PayPalSpecific_order]
===== _order_

Creating a _PayPal order_ indicates that the buyer has consented to the
purchase but does not place the funds on hold. After merchant creates an
_order_, they can place multiple authorizations upon it to place funds
on hold until ready to _capture_.

Merchants often use this technique to accept orders for items that are
not available for shipment when the order is placed. For example, when a
merchant ships items from multiple distribution centers and needs
separate _authorizations_ for each shipment. Another example would be
delayed shipping on items that are not in stock.

An _order_ is valid for 29 days. Merchant can make up to 10 referencing
_authorizations_ for each order. _order_ cannot be referenced by _debit_
transaction and cannot be voided.

_order_ request has the same fields as _authorization_ or _debit_
transactions. Similarly, the _Forward-URL_ to the
<<API_PayPal_Express, _PayPal_ Express Checkout>> is delivered in
the response, where the consumer needs to confirm the payment. In order
to finalize the payment, a regular _authorization_ transaction needs to
be submitted, referencing the prior _order_ transaction using the
Parent-Transaction-ID field.

[#API_PayPal_Configuration_Addresses]
=== Addresses

The {payment-gateway} offers three options to configure the
consumer's address:

- Transmitted address is not shown in the wallet, that means, the
address cannot be modified.
- Transmitted address is shown in the wallet AND the consumer can change
it directly in the wallet (changes will be forwarded to shop via
notification).
- Transmitted address is shown in the wallet AND the consumer cannot
change it directly in the wallet. The consumer can change his address
only in the merchant's shop.
//-

The configuration is set by
<<ContactUs, Merchant Support>>.

=== Features

[#API_PayPal_Features_Basket]
==== Basket Items

Basket item details may be sent along with debit and authorization
requests. The detailed items of the shopping basket will be displayed in
_PayPal_ during the checkout, and later stored as a part of payment
details in _PayPal_. They can also be obtained later from the {payment-gateway} as part of the transaction details.

.Basket Items

|Field |Cardinality Req/Resp |Dataype |Size |Description

|order-items.order-item.name |O |Alphanumeric | |Name of the item in the basket.

[#API_PayPal_Features_Cross]
==== Cross Merchant Account References

The default security setting for all types of reference transactions
using the field payment/parent-transaction-id allows the references only
to the transactions of the same merchant account. However it is possible
to activate cross referencing for a merchant account. With this option
activated a merchant account can reference a transaction of another
merchant account. The only requirement is that the processing user used
for the authentication of the payment request has rights on the merchant
account of the referenced transaction.

NOTE: This merchant configuration parameter affects all transaction types.
Other kinds of reference transactions such as _refund_ or _void_ can use
cross references as well. Once activated it is enabled for all payment
methods configured for a merchant account even though not all payment
providers/acquirers might support it.

_PayPal_ supports cross references natively by configuring a special
shared consumer account which can be used by several merchants.
Therefore the billing agreement ID can also be shared among several
merchants.

NOTE: The cross references must be solely enabled for the
corresponding merchant accounts of the processing user by Wirecard Support team.

The recurring transactions process in cross-reference
mode remains the same.

[#API_PayPal_Features_Provider]
==== Provider Transaction ID

This feature enables a merchant to search for transactions in
the _PayPal_ merchant dashboard directly.

The <``provider-transaction-id``> is returned in every response of an
_ExpressCheckout, Capture, Refund_ and _Referenced Transaction_ and is
also part of the respective notifications.

NOTE: The <``provider-transaction-id``> can be found in <``status``> field and it is
generated for every _PayPal_ transaction.

[#API_PayPal_Features_Seller]
==== Seller Protection & Recurring Payments

_PayPal_ offers a Seller Protection policy for merchants to help guard
from losing money to claims and chargebacks. For details of this policy
see the official _PayPal_ documentation. Terms and conditions for this
feature depend on the operating country. Please refer to your country
specific _PayPal_ Website.

The feature _Seller Protection & Recurring Payments_ is available by
default in the {payment-gateway}.

The merchant needs to provide a shipping address only in the initial
payment. For subsequent recurring payments {payment-gateway}
automatically sends the shipping address from the initial payment to
_PayPal_.

NOTE: For recurring payments __{payment-gateway}__ uses the shipping
address which has been received from _PayPal_ during the initial
request.

[#API_PayPal_Features_Cancel]
==== Cancel handling

_PayPal_ offers payment cancelation. After clicking on Cancel button,
consumer is redirected to merchant's cancel redirect URL and if merchant
has cancelation enabled, a _failed transaction_ will be created.
The response will contain the status 500.1108
``Transaction was cancelled/aborted. Please try again later.``

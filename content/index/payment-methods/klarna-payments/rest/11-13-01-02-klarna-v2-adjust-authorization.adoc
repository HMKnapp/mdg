[#Klarnav2_TransactionTypes_adjustAuthorization]
==== _adjust-authorization_

Use this transaction type to update a preceding _authorization_ or to add new information to it. 

You  can update

* order amount,
* billing address
* shipping address.

[NOTE] 
====
* You can only adjust authorizations that have not yet been captured or canceled.
* Multiple updates are possible.
//-
====

If the change of an _authorization_ increases the total order amount, _Klarna_ performs another risk check. A new risk check can lead to a rejection of the
authorization adjustment request. In this case, the initial _authorization_ is
still valid and can be updated, captured or canceled.

To refer to a specific _authorization_ or _adjust-authorization_, you need the ``parent-transaction-id``, which is the ``transaction-id`` of the preceding _authorization_ or _adjust-authorization_.

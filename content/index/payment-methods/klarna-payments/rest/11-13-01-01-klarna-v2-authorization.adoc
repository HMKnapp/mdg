[#Klarnav2_TransactionTypes_authorization]
==== _authorization_/_pending-authorization_
_Klarna_ performs a risk check before accepting an order. 

Furthermore, _Klarna_ flags **some orders** for additional review and transmits ``fraud_status pending`` to _{payment-gateway}_. For this status, _{payment-gateway}_ uses the transaction type ``pending-authorization`` and creates the final authorization transaction once _Klarna_ has completed this additional risk check.

If _Klarna_ accepts the order, it guarantees the payment once the authorized amount is captured.

. Consumer checks out products.
. -> Send an _authorization_ request to _{payment-gateway}_. This request must contain order data (e.g. amount, order number, order items), consumer data (e.g. name, billing
and shipping address, client IP address).
. _{payment-gateway}_ forwards the request to _Klarna_.
. _Klarna_ creates a session token and sends it to _{payment-gateway}_.
. _{payment-gateway}_ creates a _pending-authorization_ transaction.
. _Klarna_ performs a basic risk check:
  - If _Klarna_ accepts the order, it guarantees the payment once the _authorization_ has been captured.
  - If _Klarna_ does not accept the order, the _authorization_ is
rejected with a corresponding error code.
  - In some cases, _Klarna_ performs an <<Klarnav2_TransactionTypes_authorization_advancedRiskCheck, advanced risk check>>.
. _{payment-gateway}_  forwards the risk check result (with the corresponding status code) to you:
  - Basic risk check ok: +
   _{payment-gateway}_ sends you an _authorization_ success response and an <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN_NotificationExamples, Instant Payment Notification (IPN)>>.
  - Basic risk check failed: +
   _{payment-gateway}_ sends you an _authorization_ failure response and an <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN_NotificationExamples, IPN>>.
  - Advanced risk check necessary: +
   The _authorization_ is pending during the advanced risk check. The payment cannot be immediately authorized.
  _{payment-gateway}_ sends you a _pending-authorization_ response and an <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN_NotificationExamples, IPN>>.
. -> Inform your consumer on the payment process outcome.

. [[Klarnav2_TransactionTypes_authorization_advancedRiskCheck]]If _Klarna_ performs an advanced risk check: +
+
9.1 _Klarna_ sends the advanced risk check result to _{payment-gateway}_. +
9.2  _{payment-gateway}_ processes the advanced risk check result and sends you an _authorization_ response and an <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN_NotificationExamples, IPN>>. 
+
[NOTE]
====
_{payment-gateway}_ retrieves the risk check result every 2 hours.

If you do not receive an IPN after 26 hours (e.g. due to
a technical error), you can check the status
of a _pending-authorization_ by using the feature <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_RetrieveTransaction_TransactionID, Retrieve Transaction by Request ID>>.

  ** If the advanced risk has been completed, _{payment-gateway}_ returns the new _authorization_ transaction with the response.
  ** Otherwise, _{payment-gateway}_ returns the HTTP code 404. Please <<ContactUs, contact Wirecard Merchant Support>>

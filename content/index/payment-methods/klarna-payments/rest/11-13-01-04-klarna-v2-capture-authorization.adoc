[#KlarnaV2_TransactionTypes_captureAuthorization]
==== _capture-authorization_

When the goods or services are ready to be delivered, you have to capture an authorized order fully or partially.

[NOTE]
====
*** You cannot add new articles.
*** You cannot change the price of the ordered items, otherwise the _capture-authorization_ transaction will be rejected.
*** Every partial capture triggers the creation and sending of a new payment instruction.

//-
====

Once an authorized amount is captured, the due date for payment is set. The
default payment due date is 14 days after capturing.

_Klarna_ pays you the order amount according to the agreed billing period.

To refer to a specific _authorization_, you need the ``parent-transaction-id``, which is the ``transaction-id`` of the preceding _authorization_ or _adjust-authorization_ response.

_Klarna_ sends *payment instructions* (containing bank account details) per email to your consumer.

. -> Send an _capture-authorization_ request. This request must contain the ``parent-transaction-id``. Enter the ``transaction-id`` of the preceding _authorization_ or _adjust-authorization_ response.

 ** If the _capture-authorization_
request does not contain order items, _{payment-gateway}_ captures the total order amount, i.e. all order items of the preceding _authorization_ transaction are captured and must be delivered.
  ** Multiple partial captures are possible by sending
_capture-authorization_ requests with order items to be captured.
. _{payment-gateway}_ forwards the request to _Klarna_. 
. _Klarna_ returns the capture result.
. _{payment-gateway}_ sends you the _capture-authorization_ response which contains the status code.
. -> Process the _capture-authorization_ response.

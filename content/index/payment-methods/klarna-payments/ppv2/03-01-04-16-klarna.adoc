[#PPv2_Klarna_TransactionType_authorization]
=== Transaction Type _authorization_

With _{payment-method-name}_ you can use the transaction types _authorization_ and _auto-sale_ which both trigger an _authorization_.

An _authorization_ reserves the specified amount from the account holder’s bank account for a later transfer. It performs an order risk check and an order reservation. Once an order is reserved, the payment is guaranteed.

[#PPv2_Klarna_PostProcessing]
=== Post-Processing Operations 

{payment-page-v2-abbr} for _{payment-method-name}_ can be used for a first _authorization_ in a chain of recurring transactions. However, when it comes to referencing a transaction for any kind of post-processing operation - such as a _capture_ or _void_ of one of your _authorization_ transactions - use our <<RestApi, REST API>> directly.

IMPORTANT: Check the REST API <<KlarnaV2, _{payment-method-name}_ specification>> for details on post-processing operations for {payment-method-name}.

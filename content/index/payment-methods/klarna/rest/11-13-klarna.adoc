[#Klarna_AcceptanceChecks]
=== Acceptance Checks

Every shop integration needs to pass a special set of acceptance checks
on the Wirecard test environment before going live. <<ContactUs, Merchant Support>> provides the description of the tests to be executed to the
merchant by email. Once the test results are verified and confirmed that
they are passed successfully the merchant will receive access
credentials for the production environment and can proceed with the
integration.

The following test data needs to be used for the acceptance tests in
order to trigger specific behavior.

[#Klarna_Workflows]
=== Workflows

[#Klarna_Workflows_authorization]
==== authorization
image::images/11-13-klarna/Klarna_Workflow_Authorization.png[Klarna Workflow authorization,height=250]

- Merchant starts with an _authorization_ of the payment by sending a
transaction of the type _authorization_ to {payment-gateway}
containing the order data like amount, order number and order items
along with information about the consumer which includes name, billing
and shipment address, client IP address and optionally some additional
information based on the merchant category.
- Wirecard performs a risk check for the payment using Klarna service
call _reserve_amount_.
- If Klarna authorizes the payment, it is guaranteed for the merchant
once captured.
- If Klarna cannot guarantee the payment, the _authorization_ is
rejected with a corresponding error code.
- The result of the risk check is returned with the status code inside
the _authorization_ response to the merchant.

//-

[#Klarna_Workflows_pendingAuthorization]
==== pending-authorization

image::images/11-13-klarna/Klarna_Workflow_PendingAuthorization.png[Klarna Workflow pending-authorization,height=250]

- In case no immediate decision can be made and a manual check of the
payment must be performed by Klarna. In this case the {payment-gateway} creates a transaction of the type _pending-authorization_
instead and returns it in the response. It means the _authorization_ is
pending and cannot be immediately activated.
- Wirecard takes care of the requesting the actual status of a pending
_authorization_ and will notify the merchant system about the status
change using the standard
<<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPN_NotificationExamples, Instant Payment Notification>> (IPN) mechanism.
With such a notification
an _authorization_ transaction with the corresponding state
_success/failed_ and status code and description is sent to the merchant
system asynchronously.
- This new _authorization_ transaction is stored in the system and has
the parent transaction ID referencing the pending-authorization
transaction.
- The check of the _authorization_ status is performed every 2 hours and
thus the IPN can only be sent out in regular time periods.
- The maximum time period for a decision at Klarna is 24 hours after the
_authorization_ and thus a corresponding IPN will be delivered within 26
hours.
- It still can occur that no IPN is received after 26 hours e.g. due to
a technical error. The merchant has the possibility to check the status
of a _pending-authorization_ using the request retrieving transaction by
the request ID used for the _authorization_ as described here
<<GeneralPlatformFeatures_RetrieveTransaction_TransactionID, Retrieve Transaction by Request ID>>.
In case a manual decision has been made, the
new _authorization_ transaction is returned with the response. If not,
the HTTP code 404 is returned.
- Please contact Wirecard Customer Support if a pending-authorization
transaction still has no corresponding _authorization_ transaction after
26 hours.

[#Klarna_Workflows_authorizationRenewal]
==== authorization-renewal

image::images/11-13-klarna/Klarna_Workflow_AuthorizationRevewal.png[Klarna Workflow authorization-renewal,height=250]

NOTE: It is only possible to extend the reservation expiry date after it has
already expired.

- An _authorization_ is valid by default for 14 days.
- After the _authorization_ is expired, it cannot be activated, but can
be prolonged using the _authorization-renewal_ transaction using Klarna
service call _extend_expiry_date_.
- A new expiration data is returned with the _authorization-renewal_
response.

//-

[#Klarna_Workflows_adjustAuthorization]
==== adjust-authorization

image::images/11-13-klarna/Klarna_Workflow_AdjustAuthorization.png[Klarna Workflow adjust-authorization,height=250]

NOTE: A risk check can be performed with every update, if the total order
amount is increased. A new risk check can lead to rejection of the
_authorization_ adjustment. In this case the last _authorization_ is
still valid and can be updated or captured.

- An order can be updated before it is activated.
- Multiple updates are possible.
- Merchant sends an _adjust-authorization_ transaction with parent
transaction ID referencing the previous _authorization_ or
_adjust-authorization_ transaction. Wirecard is using Klarna call
_update._
 The following data can be updated: order number, the order items and
thus the amount, the consumer's name, billing and shipment address.
- The data sent with the _adjust-authorization_ transaction will replace
the data from the parent _authorization_ /_adjust-authorization_
transaction.
- The result of the adjustment is returned with the status code inside
the _adjust-authorization_ response to the merchant.

//-

[#Klarna_voidAuthorization]
==== void-authorization

NOTE: A partial captured reservation still can be cancelled. In this case only
not yet captured order items are cancelled.

- It is possible to cancel a payment authorization before it is fully
captured.
- It should be performed in case the goods or service are not available
or the consumer would like to cancel his order.
- Not cancelled authorizations can influence the risk decisions for the
further payments of a particular consumer or even other consumers.
- Merchant sends a _void-authorization_ transaction with parent
transaction ID referencing the _authorization_/_adjust-authorization_
transaction to be cancelled. Wirecard is using Klarna call
_cancel_reservation_.
- A pending-authorization can be cancelled as well.
- The cancellation can be approved or rejected which is reported by the
transaction state and status code in the response.
- The reservation is not valid after cancellation any longer and cannot
be updated or activated.

[#Klarna_captureAuthorization]
==== capture-authorization

image::images/11-13-klarna/Klarna_Workflow_CaptureAuthorization.png[Klarna Workflow capture-authorization,height=250]

NOTE: In case of the payment instructions, the merchant is responsible to send
by himself the invoices to his consumers. The Klarna bank account
requisites, where the payment should be provided to, can be taken from
the payment instructions.

- Merchant must capture an _authorization_ when the goods or services
are ready to be delivered.
- This call will inform Wirecard and Klarna using _activate_ call that
the order is being shipped.
- Depending on the merchant configuration Klarna will then send an
invoice or payment instructions to the consumer according to the
provided invoice delivery option: via email, via post or it can be
downloaded and enclosed in the delivered package.
- The download link is provided regardless of the invoice delivery
option inside the response. The link is valid for 30 days and will be
removed afterwards.
- Once _authorization_ is captured the due date for payment is set. The
default invoice due date is 14 days after activation.
- The payout to merchant will only occur for the captured payments.
- To capture an order merchant sends a _capture-authorization_
transaction with parent transaction ID referencing the
_authorization_/_adjust-authorization_ transaction to be captured.
- If no order items are provided with the _capture-authorization_
transaction, this is a full capture, i.e. all order items of the
referenced transaction are activated and must be delivered.
- Multiple partial captures are possible by sending
_capture-authorization_ transactions with order items to be activated.
- Please note that no new articles can be added.
- The price of the existing articles cannot be changed as well,
otherwise the _capture-authorization_ transaction will be rejected.
- With every partial capture a new invoice and payment instructions are
generated and sent out.

//-

[#Klarna_refundCapture]
==== refund-capture

image::images/11-13-klarna/Klarna_Workflow_RefundCapture.png[Klarna Workflow refund-capture,height=250]

- If a consumer returns all or some items, the merchant needs to issue a
refund by sending a _refund-capture_ transaction with parent transaction
ID referencing the _capture-authorization_ transaction to be refunded.
Wirecard is using the Klarna call _credit_part_.
- For every separate captured payment (invoice) made by a
_capture-authorization_ transaction a separate refund must be issued by
a _refund-capture_ transaction.
- If no order items are provided with the _refund-capture_ transaction,
a full refund of the referenced captured payment will be executed.
- For partial refunds order items to be refunded need to be provided in
the request.
- The price of the articles to be refunded cannot be changed, otherwise
the _refund-capture_ transaction will be rejected.
- It is also possible to issue a so-called good-will refund which is a
new discount item in the _refund-capture_ transaction. It can be also
used to issue change vouchers. The new order item must explicitly have
the type _discount_ in order to be processed as good-will refund,
otherwise it will be rejected as not existing item to be refunded.
- The other possibility is to add some additional shipment or handling
fees for a refund. It increases the order amount but the fee amount
itself cannot go over the total amount of the refunded items. To add
additional fees that may occur at the merchant side (shipping fee or
handling fee) merchant has to provide new order item(s) with the type
_shipment_fee_ or _handling_fee._

//-

[#Klarna_revokeCapture]
==== revoke-capture

In case of fraud if the Merchant has violated the Klarna shipping
policies, Klarna might revoke the payment guarantee afterwards. In this
case the corresponding payment amount will be subtracted from the
payout. A new transaction of the type _revoke-capture_ referencing  the
_capture-authorization_ transaction will be created internally, the
amount of the revoke transaction will be equal to the amount of the
referenced _capture_ transaction.

[#Klarna_adjustCapture]
==== adjust-capture

In case of fraud where Klarna fulfills the payment guarantee, the amount
paid out to the merchant will be reduced by the VAT value. A new
transaction of the type _adjust-capture_ referencing  the
_capture-authorization_ transaction will be created internally, the
amount of the adjust transaction will be equal to the VAT amount of the
referenced _capture_ transaction.

[#Klarna_VoucherHandling]
==== Voucher Handling

Vouchers can be provided as order items with the type _discount_ in the
_authorization_/_adjust-authorization_ request. Every voucher must have
its unique article number. The voucher amount cannot be higher than the
total amount of the articles.

[#Klarna_VoucherHandling_captureVoucher]
===== capture Voucher

In case of full _capture_ vouchers are captured among with the other
articles.

In case of partial _capture_ the captured voucher amount cannot be
higher than the total amount of all captured articles. The merchant can
use the following options for voucher handling in partial _capture_
scenario:

[#Klarna_VoucherHandling_ReCalculation]
===== Re-Calculation and Split of Voucher Amount Based on Partially Activated Article

.General formula for calculation
----
voucher proportion for single article = single article amount / amount of all articles voucher is related to * total voucher amount
----

.Example Basket
- Article A = 5 Euro
- Article B = 95 Euro
- Voucher C (discount item) = 10 Euro (10% of total basket amount)

//-

.Example Adjustment authorization
- Article A = 5 Euro
- Article B = 95 Euro
- Voucher for Article A: 5/100*10 = 0,5 Euro
- Voucher for Article B: 95/100*10 = 9,5 Euro

//-

.Example Partial capture:
- Article A = 5 Euro
- Voucher for Article A = 0,5 Euro

//-

[#Klarna_ReCalculate_AvoidNegative]
===== Re-Calculate and Split Voucher to avoid Negative Invoice for Partial Activation

.Example Basket
- Voucher for article A: 5 Euro (<= max. amount of partial
activation)
- Voucher for article B: 5 Euro (remaining voucher amount after
subtracting value
- of voucher of partial activation)

//-

.Example Adjustment authorization
- Article A = 5 Euro
- Article B = 95 Euro
- Voucher for article A = 5 Euro
- Voucher for article B = 5 Euro

//-

.Example Partial capture
- Article A = 5 Euro
- Voucher for Article A = 5 Euro

//-

NOTE: In case of uneven amounts the calculation and rounding of amounts should
be done with 2 decimal numbers. Since Klarna ignores more than 2 decimal
digits this is important to guarantee identical prices in the
_authorization_ and in the order in the shop system.

If the voucher is based on the overall basket amount and a partial
capture (article + voucher) is going to be performed, followed by a
cancellation of the remaining (not captured) articles, the merchant has
the possibility to change (decrease) the amount of the voucher before
activation using adjust authorization request. After a capture it will
not be possible to decrease the amount of the already captured voucher.

Voucher is refunded like all other articles (using refund-capture call
without any order items or including all order items). It must be
possible to identify every voucher through its unique article number. If
you refund a voucher, it means its amount is subtracted from the total
refund amount.

[#Klarna_PartialVoucherRefund]
==== Partial Voucher Refund

- If other articles are to be refunded, a remaining voucher must not
lead to a negative invoice amount.
- A refund of a voucher may not lead to an increased total invoice
amount. This would be a special case which needs additional contractual
agreements and general approving for a merchant by Wirecard and Klarna
Business Underwriting beforehand, otherwise the call would be rejected.
- In case of a partial refund, the merchant might want to reduce a given
voucher. In this case the voucher can either be refunded completely and
a new voucher be added in the credit_part call, or a correcting
voucher/article can be added to decrease the total discount.

//-

The following example depicts both cases:

.Reservation
- Article A = 100 Euro
- Article B = 100 Euro
- Voucher C = 20 Euro (10% on basket given for baskets exceeding 150 Euros)

//-

.Activation
- Article A = 100 Euro
- Article B = 100 Euro
- Voucher C = 20 Euro

//-

NOTE: Consumer returns article A, total basket amount is lower than
150 Euro, therefore merchant does not want to give a voucher anymore or
wants to decrease the voucher.

.Option 1 - remove voucher completely
- Refund
* Article A = 100 Euro
* Voucher C = 20 Euro

//-

.Option 2 - remove voucher completely and add new lower voucher
- Refund
* Article A = 100 Euro
* Voucher C = 20 Euro
* Add new voucher D (new item with discount type) = 10 Euro

//-

.Option 3 - keep voucher and add fee item to decrease overall given discount
- Refund
* Refund A = 100 Euro
* Add a new item with the fee type to decrease Voucher = 10 Euro

//-

NOTE: If the decrease of the voucher is based on the overall basket
amount, a calculation as in the first example should be performed.

[#Klarna_AdditionalMerchantData]
==== Additional Merchant Data

Extra Merchant Data (EMD) is additional data variables that a merchant
can send in to Wirecard in the API call in excess of the goods list. The
added value from the merchant's perspective is that Klarna will to a
higher extent have the possibility of scoring the merchant's consumers,
which in turn will result in an improved likelihood of higher acceptance
rate. It also allows Klarna to gain valuable data in segments/concepts
where it otherwise would be hard for Klarna to operate in (for example
business concepts such as travel, digital goods, marketplaces etc.).

The content of this field is a JSON alphanumeric presenting the
hierarchical additional merchant data for Klarna. Please contact your
Wirecard sales account manager in order to clarify what packages are
required for your integration.

[#Klarna_getAddress]
==== get-address for Swedish Consumers

image::images/11-13-klarna/Klarna_Workflow_Get-Address.png[Klarna Workflow get-address for Swedish Customers,height=250]

For the Swedish private persons Klarna requires exact match of the
address data in the ``authorization``/``adjust-authorization`` requests. In case
of some deviations, the internal risk check might fail and the
transaction gets rejected. In order to avoid the address mismatches
Wirecard and Klarna offer a special online service which retrieves the
official address(es) of the consumer by his social security number. The
found address(es) need to be displayed on the checkout page to the
consumer where he needs to choose and confirm one. The confirmed address
should be used in the corresponding ``authorization``/``adjust-authorization``
request.

Please note the following requirements:

- The function can only used for private consumers with a Swedish social
security number.
- Consumer data is only retrieved for Klarna's payment methods in the
checkout.
- The function may not be used for consumer registration out of payment
scope.
- The function may only be used after providing the consumer with
Klarna's terms & conditions.
- The Get Address UI elements and received data must disappear if the
consumer chooses another payment method.
- The consumer needs to actively press a button to collect the data, it
may not be triggered by completion of a form field.
- The button is not allowed to be named Get Address (hämta address).
Approved names: Fetch (Hämta), Continue (Fortsätt), Search (Sök),
Proceed (Vidare).

[#Klarna_InstallmentCalculator]
==== Installment Calculator for Guaranteed Payment on Installment

image::images/11-13-klarna/Klarna_Workflow_InstallmentCalculator.png[Klarna Workflow of Installment Calculator,height=250]

The Installment Calculator service can be used to retrieve the available
installment plans offered by Klarna. Merchant sends the order amount and
the ISO locale code including country and language, and retrieves the
list of available installment plans for these input data. The available
installment plans (also called payment options) need to be shown to the
buyer on the checkout page. When the buyer chooses the appropriate
installment plan, its pclass needs to be sent with the payment
authorization request to the {payment-gateway}. For Germany,
Sweden, Finland and Norway there are additional UI related information
returned in the response (e.g. the description of the particular
installment plan localized for the corresponding locale) which helps
displaying the installment plans on the checkout page. Please note the
country specific requirements for displaying the installment plans and
additional information and confirmations on the shop checkout page
described in chapter https://developers.klarna.com/en/de/kpm/guidelines
(Link for presentation guidelines in Germany, please use country
selector at the top of the page to change to guidelines for other
countries). For the flexible installment plans there is no calculation
of monthly payment amount, annual percentage rate and total purchase
amount performed and thus these fields are not returned for the
corresponding installment plan in the response. Although for Germany,
Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark the field *use-case* still
contains a text with the calculation example.

[#Klarna_Reconciliation]
=== Settlement Reports - Reconciliation

_Klarna_ takes full credit and fraud risk and guarantees full payments.
However, there are 3 exceptions:

- _Klarna_ rejects the payment guarantee if you have violated the shipping policies.
- _Klarna_ rejects the payment guarantee in case of chargeback.
- In fraud cases where Klarna accepts the liability, _Klarna_ reduces the payout amount by the VAT.

//-

_Klarna_ records these occurences in settlement reports. Settlement reports explain in detail all payment flows between _Klarna_ and you, thus helping you to reconcile your accounts. Each settlement report is linked to a specific payout by the unique payment reference which appears on your bank account statement.

Settlement reports are collected in <<Reporting_DataReconciliation, reconciliation files>> that you can download and process.

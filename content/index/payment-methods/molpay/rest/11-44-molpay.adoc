. Consumer initiates a debit transaction.
. Merchant sends a request to the {payment-gateway-abbr} endpoint. This request must contain 
  - the transaction type ``debit``
  - the selected payment method (channel)
  - the consumer's data

. {payment-gateway-abbr} sends a response to merchant. This response contains a generated URL for _MOLPay_'s landing page (field “payment-methods/payment-method/@url”).
. With this URL, the merchant redirects the consumer to _MOLPay_'s landing page.
. The consumer submits the transaction on _MOLPay_'s landing page and is redirected to their online banking system.
. The consumer finishes the payment in their online banking system. Optionally, the consumer can be redirected back to the shop.

[#PPv2_paysafecard_About]
=== About _paysafecard_

_paysafecard_ is a well-known prepaid electronic payment method for mainly
online shopping e.g. in gaming, social media & communities and music, film &
entertainment industries. _paysafecard_ is currently available in many
countries and languages all over the world. It offers a broad selection
of currencies to choose from.

Consumers either purchase a _paysafecard_ voucher which contains a
16-digit PIN from sales outlets or from authorized online PIN shops, or
alternatively, create a _my paysafecard account_ defining their personal
username and password.

_paysafecard_ PINs can be used multiple times for paying in online shops
or for topping up the _my paysafecard account_.

Using _my paysafecard_ during the payment process in an online shop, you
do not have to reenter the PIN again, only username and password are
required.

Paying with _paysafecard_, the consumer enters the 16 digit number and the
amount tendered is deducted from the _paysafecard_ balance. Thus, the same
PIN code can be used multiple times. For larger sums, it is possible to
combine various _paysafecard_ PINs. Combining PINs also allows consumers
to use up any remaining credit on a _paysafecard_ PIN. The current balance
of each _paysafecard_ as well as its transaction history and production
date can be viewed at the official _paysafecard_ site by entering the
respective 16 digit PIN code.

Payments for goods or services other than EUR are converted into EUR at
the conversion rate at the time of purchase. The conversion fee varies
depending on the original currency and end currency and it varies from
country to country. The currency conversion rates for foreign currencies
are always available on the _paysafecard_ web site.

[#PPv2_paysafecard_TransactionType_debit]
=== Transaction Type _debit_

A _debit_ transaction charges the consumer's _paysafecard_ account with the
specified amount and transfers it immediately.

For a successful _debit_ transaction:

. Create a payment session (initial _debit_ request).
. Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

//-

We provide ready-made JSON examples for each step of this process. You
can find them below.

<<PPv2_paysafecard_TestCredentials, Endpoint>> for _paysafecard_ payments.

.Initial Request

The initial request creates the payment session. If it is
successful, you receive a URL as a response which redirects to the payment form.

|Field (JSON) |Data Type |Description

|payment-redirect-url |String |The URL which redirects to the payment
form (hosted by _paysafecard_). Sent as a response to the initial request.
|===

At this point, you need to redirect your consumer to
``payment-redirect-url`` (or render it in an _iframe_ depending on your
<<PPv2, integration method>>).

Consumers are redirected to the payment form. There they enter their
data and submit the form to confirm the payment. A payment can be:

- successful (``transaction-state: success``),
- failed (``transaction-state: failed``),
- canceled. The consumer canceled the payment before/after submission
(``transaction-state: failed``).

//-

The transaction result is the value of ``transaction-state`` in the
payment response. More details (including the status code) can also be
found in the payment response in the ``statuses`` object. Canceled
payments are returned as  _failed_, but the ``status description`` indicates it
was canceled.

In any case (unless the consumer cancels the transaction on a 3rd party
provider page), a base64 encoded response containing payment information
is sent to the configured redirection URL. See
<<PPSolutions_PPv2_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for {payment-page-v2-abbr}>>﻿﻿
for more details on redirection targets after payment & transaction status
notifications.

You can find a decoded payment response example below.

[#PPv2_paysafecard_TransactionType_authorization]
=== Transaction Type _authorization_

An _authorization_

- reserves funds on a consumer's _paysafecard_ account (e.g. until the
merchant ships/delivers the goods/services).
- does not trigger money transfer.

//-

To transfer money, the amount has to be captured with the transaction
type _capture-authorization_.

For a successful _authorization_ transaction

. Create an _authorization_ session (initial _authorization_ request).
. Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

[#PPv2_paysafecard_void]

You may cancel an _authorization_ using the <<RestApi, REST API>> if the
_authorization_ was successful and has neither been captured nor voided before.

Only the whole authorized amount may be voided.

For a void process you must provide a ``parent-transaction-id``. This is the
``transaction-id`` of the preceding _authorization_. You can gather it from the
response to a successful authorization.

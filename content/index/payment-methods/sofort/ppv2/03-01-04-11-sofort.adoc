[#PPv2_Sofort_General]
=== General Information

This is a reference page for _Sofort._ Here you find all the information
necessary for integrating this payment method into your Hosted and Embedded Payment Page.

.Are you unfamiliar with {payment-page-v2} ({payment-page-v2-abbr})?

NOTE: Visit one of the integration guides
(<<PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_HPP_Integration, Hosted>>,
<<PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_EPP_Integration, Embedded>>) for a quick explanation and
a step-by-step guide before continuing.

All <<PPv2, {payment-page-v2-abbr}>> integrations share a
<<PPSolutions_PPv2_Workflow, common process flow>> for creating payments.

Below, you find example requests for the available transaction type
<<PPv2_Sofort_TransactionType_debit, _debit_>>, 
including field lists with short descriptions.

These requests are designed for the testing environment and do not
use real information.

NOTE: For production, you need to use production credentials. For details
contact <<ContactUs, merchant support>>.

All given requests return successful responses.

For more details on the ``redirect-url``, see the 
<<PPSolutions_PPv2_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for {payment-page-v2-abbr}>> 
section.

[#PPv2_Sofort_TransactionType_debit]
=== Transaction Type _debit_

A _debit_ transaction charges the specified amount from the account
holder's bank account and marks it for immediate transfer.

For a successful _debit_ transaction:

. Create a payment session (initial request).
. Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).
. Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

//-

We provide ready-made JSON examples for each step of this process. You
find them below.

<<PPv2_Sofort_TestCredentials, Endpoint>> for _Sofort_ transactions.

.Initial Request

The initial request creates the payment session. If it is
successful, you receive a URL as a response which redirects to the payment form.

placeholder for a random ``request-id``.

Allowed characters:  [a-z0-9-_]
2+| transaction-type          | String | Mandatory | 36 | The requested transaction type. For _Sofort_ payments, the
transaction-type must be set to ``debit``.
.2+| requested-amount e| value | Numeric | Mandatory | 18 | The full amount that is requested/contested in a transaction. 2 decimal
places allowed.

Use . (decimal point) as the separator.

                       | currency | String | Mandatory | 3 | The currency of the requested/contested transaction amount. For _Sofort_
                         payments, the currency must be set to ``EUR``.

.2. Redirect the Consumer to the Payment Page (Initial Response URL)

[source,json,subs=attributes+]

include::{root}/samples/json/WPP_SofortTransactionTypeDebit_2RtCttPPIRU.json[]

[cols="15e,10,75"]
|===
| Field (JSON) | Data Type | Description

| payment-redirect-url | String | The URL which redirects to the payment
form. Sent as a response to the initial request.
|===


At this point, you need to redirect your consumer to
``payment-redirect-url`` (or render it in an _iframe_ depending on your
<<PPv2, integration method>>).

Consumers are redirected to the payment form. There they enter their
data and submit the form to confirm the payment. A payment can be:

- successful (``transaction-state: success``),
- failed (``transaction-state: failed``),
- canceled. The consumer canceled the payment before/after submission
(``transaction-state: failed``).

//-

The transaction result is the value of ``transaction-state`` in the
payment response. More details (including the status code) can also be
found in the payment response in the ``statuses`` object. Canceled
payments are returned as _failed_, but the
``status description`` indicates it was canceled.

In any case (unless the consumer cancels the transaction on a 3rd party
provider page), a base64-encoded response containing payment information
is sent to the configured redirection URL. See
<<PPSolutions_PPv2_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for {payment-page-v2-abbr}>>
for more details on redirection targets after payment and transaction status
notifications.

You can find a decoded payment response example below.

[#PPv2_Sofort_PostProcessing]
=== Post-Processing Operations 

{payment-page-v2-abbr} is best used to deal with one-off payments (e.g. regular,
independent _debit_ transactions) or the initial transaction in a chain of
them (e.g. a first _authorization_ in a chain of recurring transactions).
However, when it comes to referencing a transaction for any kind of
post-processing operation - such as a refund of one of your _debit_ transactions
- use our <<RestApi, REST API>> directly.

WARNING: A direct refund through {payment-page-v2-abbr} is not possible for _Sofort_ so you have to
obtain your consumer's banking information and send the refund using
_SEPA Credit Transfer_. +
Check the REST API <<SEPACreditTransfer, _SEPA Credit Transfer_ specification>> for details on
_Sofort_ specific post-processing operations.

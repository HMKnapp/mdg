[#Sofort_Workflow]
=== Workflow

image::images/11-31-sofort/Sofort_successful_transaction.png[Workflow of Successful Transaction]

. Consumer chooses Sofort on the merchant's payment page
. Consumer is re-directed and logs in to his/her online banking account
. Consumer confirms the payment
. Consumer is re-directed to the Sofort confirmation page
//-

In the case of a successful payment, the consumer is redirected back to
merchant's website and the {payment-gateway} sends the merchant a
notification of the successful transaction.

If the notification is not sent, the merchant has the possibility to
send a request to <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_RetrieveTransaction_TransactionID, Retrieve Transaction by Transaction-ID>>
or to <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_RetrieveTransaction_RequestID, Retrieve Transaction by Request-ID>>.

The response will enable the merchant to retrieve the current status of
the requested transaction.

====

[#Sofort_AdditionalFeatures_SofortLook]
==== The Look of _Sofort._ on the Merchant's Website

_Sofort_ requires merchants to follow certain guidelines when offering
the payment method on their website.

_Sofort_ recommends to place a link instead of the badge. By using the
link, _Sofort_. will host the badge and update it automatically on the
merchant's web site.

_Sofort_ provides the badges in two formats and allows individual
sizes:

- The format is either svg or png. It is the merchant's decision which
format to use by setting the correct file extension.
- Using png determines the size directly according to the format.
Leaving the size blank, the badge will be delivered with the standard
width of 100 pixel.
- _Sofort_ suggests a width between 100 and 300 pixel. To change the
width from 100 pixel to e.g. 300 pixel, add "?width=300" directly after
the format.
//-

The following is the general form of the link to the badge:

``\https://cdn.klarna.com/1.0/shared/image/generic/badge/xx_XX/[name_of_the_badge]/standard/pink.[format][size]``

[#Sofort_Examples]
===== Examples

. Use the _Sofort_ badge with the svg format and the standard size:

``\https://cdn.klarna.com/1.0/shared/image/generic/badge/xx_XX/pay_now/standard/pink.svg``
[start=2]
. Display the badge with the png format and the size 300 pixel:

``\https://cdn.klarna.com/1.0/shared/image/generic/badge/xx_XX/pay_now/standard/pink.png?width=300``

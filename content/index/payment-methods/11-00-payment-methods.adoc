==== Credit Card and Debit Card

This section describes the difference between Credit Card and Debit Card
payments and their respective advantages.

<<API_PM_CC_PaymentMode_Debit, Debit Card>>

<<API_PM_CC_PaymentMode_Credit, Credit Card>>

[#API_PM_CC_PaymentMode_Debit]
[discrete]
===== Debit Card

A debit card (also known as a bank card or check card) is a payment card that
can be used instead of cash when making purchases. It is similar to a credit
card, but unlike a credit card, the money comes directly from the user's bank
account when performing a transaction.

Some cards may bear a stored value with which a payment is made, while most
relay a message to the cardholder's bank to withdraw funds from a payer's
designated bank account. In some cases, the primary account number is assigned
exclusively for use on the Internet and there is no physical card.

In many countries, the use of debit cards has become so widespread that their
volume has overtaken or entirely replaced cheques and, in some instances, cash
transactions. The development of debit cards, unlike credit cards and charge
cards, has generally been country specific resulting in a number of different
systems around the world, which were often incompatible. Since the mid-2000s,
a number of initiatives have allowed debit cards issued in one country to be
used in other countries and allowed their use for internet and phone purchases.

[#API_PM_CC_PaymentMode_Debit_Advantage]
[discrete]
====== Advantages

- A debit card immediately transfers the payment from the cardholder's designated
bank account.
- Debit cards allow instant withdrawal of cash.
- Merchants may also offer cashback facilities to customers, where a customer
can withdraw cash along with their purchase.
- A debit card requires the balance to be repaid in full each month.
Debit card defers payment by the cardholder until a later date.

[#API_PM_CC_PaymentMode_Credit]
[discrete]
===== Credit Card

A credit card is a payment card issued to a cardholder to enable the cardholder
to pay a merchant for goods and services, based on the cardholder's promise to
the card issuer to pay them for the amounts so paid plus other agreed charges.
The card issuer (usually a bank) creates a revolving account and grants a line
of credit to the cardholder, from which the cardholder can borrow money for
payment to a merchant or as a cash advance.

.Prepaid Credit Card
In the same context prepaid credit card can be used. The prepaid credit card
in opposite to the standard credit card cannot be used without enough money on
it (the referring account). These cards can be used for payments only in case
the card owner has enough money on his card. In this case the card holder can
perform the same actions like with standard credit card up to the limit of the
card until no funds are left.

[#API_PM_CC_PaymentMode_Credit_Advantage]
[discrete]
====== Advantages

- A credit card allows continuing balance of debt, subject to interest being
charged.
- A credit card typically involves a third-party entity that pays the seller and
is reimbursed by the cardholder.

|[[PaymentMethods_PaymentMode_OnlineBankTransfer]]_Online Bank Transfer_
|_Online Bank Transfer_ is a payment mode which enables shoppers to
directly do the payment when ordering the product.

Payment confirmation for this payment mode is sent in real time through
{payment-gateway}. 

After a successful payment, the transaction may no longer be revoked by
the consumer and the merchant can ship the ordered product or service
immediately.
|An _Online Bank Transfer_ offers the option to perform secure online
payments to consumers, who

- do not own a credit/debit card.
- do not want to use a credit/debit card when shopping in the internet.

With an _Online Bank Transfer_ consumers

- transfer money in their personal online banking environment.
- do not share personal bank account details with the merchant.

This increases the conversion rate for merchants as well as the customer
satisfaction.

|[[PaymentMethods_PaymentMode_OfflineBankTransfer]]_Offline Bank Transfer_
|_Offline Bank Transfer_ is a payment mode which enables shoppers to
decouple the payment from the delivery of the product they ordered.

This means during your shopping event, wherever you do it, you order
something and you pay for it not by directly using your credit card,
your online banking, etc. You tell your merchant that you want to buy
his product and you get a kind of invoice for it.

With that invoice you can do e.g. a money transfer (SEPA Deposit).

So order/shipping and payment are decoupled.

The payment confirmation for this type of payment mode is sent in a
batch process through {payment-gateway}.
|An _Offline Bank Transfer_ offers the option to perform secure online
payments to consumers, who

- do not own a credit/debit card
- do not want to use a credit/debit card shopping in the internet

This increases the conversion rate for merchants as well as the customer
satisfaction.

|[[PaymentMethods_PaymentMode_MobilePayment]]_Mobile Payment_
|Payment methods offer _Mobile Payment_ as an additional variant to
their traditional payment possibilities. Therefore it is not possible to
assign mobile payment to either _Credit/Debit Card_ or an APM.

The usage of smartphones and tablets has massively assisted in the
development of mobile payments. Meanwhile, a wide-range of products
are available on the market, using different kinds of technologies.
{payment-gateway} already supports several mobile payment
options.
|A mobile payment method is an attractive alternative to a consumer's
credit card. Some consumers enjoy the comfort to pay with a mobile
device and charge the monthly telecommunication bill.

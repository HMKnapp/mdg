[#PP_HPP_Integration_PaymentMethodSelection]
=== Hosted Payment Page with Payment Method Selection

Integration is as easy as including one JavaScript library into the merchant's checkout page:

[source,html,subs=attributes+]
----
<script src="https://{test-instance-hostname}/engine/hpp/paymentPageLoader.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
----


Specification of the payment data:

[source,js,subs=attributes+]
----
var requestedData = {
  merchant_account_id: "61e8c484-dbb3-4b69-ad8f-706f13ca141b",
  request_id: "c68b9039-968d-1c6b-d9f6-27e9ab2bcb3e",
  request_time_stamp: "20200116084718",
  payment_method: "creditcard",
  transaction_type: "authorization",
  requested_amount: "2.56",
  requested_amount_currency: "EUR",
  locale: "en",
  request_signature: "e44730486d180cca590bc2e8dea22bd175395636a37b0da0ef785"
}
----

ifdef::env-wirecard[]
A function call of that library provides the payment functionality:

[source,js,subs=attributes+]
----
{payment-page-function}.hostedPay(requestedData);
----


Or call a different name library with the same functionality:

[source,js,subs=attributes+]
----
ElasticPaymentPage.hostedPay(requestedData);
----
endif::[]

ifndef::env-wirecard[]
A function call of that library provides the payment functionality.
endif::[]

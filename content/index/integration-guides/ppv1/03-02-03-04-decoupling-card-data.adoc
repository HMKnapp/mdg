[#Seamless_DecouplingCardData]
== Decoupling Card Data Collection from Payment

When the merchant decides to display a recap order page between the
payment data collection page and actually submitting the payment,
the merchant may use the payment form to perform a:

- Zero authorization transaction that may later be referenced by a
regular authorization or purchase. The advantage for credit card
payments is that a zero authorization transaction is confirmed by an
issuer and the CVC is verified.
- Tokenization-only transaction. A token (non-sensitive data) is
returned to the merchant that can be used for a real authorization or
purchase later.

//-

In either case, sensitive payment data will not touch any of the
merchant's systems.

The difference to the previous scenario is that an ``authorization-only``
transaction type with a zero amount is used instead of a ``purchase``
transaction type (``tokenization`` transaction type may be used for a
similar effect), and the real fund booking only comes in the third
(additional) step. The payment form is displayed directly on the merchant's
checkout page.

[#Seamless_DecouplingCardData_RenderForm]
=== Render Form

The merchant renders the form into an element on their checkout page. The
transaction details are specified in ``requestData``. The element is
identified by ``wrappingDivId`` parameter.

[#Seamless_DecouplingCardData_SubmitForm]
=== Submit Form

The merchant will assign call of the function to a pay button on their
checkout page. ``requestData`` are optional when submitting the form. They will
be merged with data from the first step. Form input is validated before
the submit.

[#Seamless_DecouplingCardData_ActualPayment]
=== Actual Payment

The merchant can now reference an existing authorization-only transaction to
do a payment without further consumer involvement. The merchant may also
do this using the function from {payment-provider-name}'s JavaScript library from the
browser.

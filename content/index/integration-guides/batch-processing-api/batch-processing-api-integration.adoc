[#BatchProcessingApi_Workflow]
=== Workflow

image::images/05-00-batch-processing-api/workflow-batch-processing-api.png[Batch Processing API Workflow]

. The Merchant Operator applies <<BatchProcessingApi_PGP, Pretty Good Privacy>>
(PGP) encryption using Wirecard's public key and uploads the encrypted request
file via SFTP to the ``from/new`` folder (eg: ``from<foldername>/new`` folder).
. The Batch Processing Service retrieves the request file and moves
the original request file from the ``new`` to the ``processed`` subfolders
if the upload was successful (eg: ``from<foldername>/new`` subfolder to
the ``from<foldername>/processed`` subfolder). In case of uploading error,
the request file is moved to the ``error`` subfolder (eg:
``from<foldername>/error``)
. The Batch Processing Service processes each transaction in the
request file and generates a PGP encrypted response file using the
Merchant's Public Key.
. When processing was successful, the encrypted response file is
deposited in the ``to<foldername>/new`` folder on the SFTP server. In
case processing failed due to a corrupted request file, the request file
is stored into folder ``to<foldername>/error``.
. The merchant operator retrieves the encrypted response file and
decrypts it using their private key.

[#BatchProcessingApi_SFTPforBatchProcessing]
=== SFTP for Batch Processing

SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) is used to securely transfer files
between the merchant and the Batch Processing Service.

[#BatchProcessingApi_ServerDirectoryStructure]
==== Server Directory Structure

Once logged onto the SFTP server, the merchant or partner is
automatically connected by its customer or partner number (e.g. ``C0001``)
to the file repository, set up by Wirecard. In the root window of the
remote SFTP server site (Wirecard server) the following subdirectories
are available:

.Remote SFTP Server
image::images/05-00-batch-processing-api/sftp-server-directory-structure.png[SFTP Server Directory Structure]

The folders ``from<foldername>`` (eg: ``fromC0001`` or ``fromP0001``) and
``to<foldername>`` (eg: ``toC0001`` or ``toP0001``) are important for the batch
processing. They are used for upload (``from<foldername>``) and download
(``to<foldername>``) files by the merchant.

Folder ``from<foldername>`` contains the following three subfolder.

.Remote SFTP Server Subfolders
image::images/05-00-batch-processing-api/sftp-server-directory-structure-subfolder.png[SFTP Server Directory Structure of Subfolders]

- ``error`` The folder to where the request file is moved
by the batch server in case an upload problem occurred.
- ``new`` The folder where the Merchant uploads his
(encrypted) request files.
- ``processed`` The folder to where the correctly processed request files are
moved by the batch service.

//-

Folder ``to<foldername>`` contains the same named subfolders used for

- ``error`` The folder where the batch processing service
stores the request file in case of the request file was corrupted.
- ``new`` The folder where the batch processing service
deposits the encrypted response file.
- ``processed`` The folder where the Merchant stores the response file after
it is picked up.

//-

The response file contains ``success`` and ``failed`` transactions.


[#BatchProcessingApi_UploadDownload]
=== Upload/Download

[#BatchProcessingApi_UploadRequestFiles]
==== Upload Request Files

. Login to SFTP server.
. Open folder ``from<foldername>``
. Copy your batch files to the subfolder ``new``.

//-

[#BatchProcessingApi_DownloadResponseFiles]
==== Download Response Files

. Login to SFTP server.
. Open the folder ``to<foldername>``
. Retrieve the response files from the subfolder ``new`` and save them
to your local machine.
. Move the response files from subfolder ``new`` to subfolder
``processed``, in order to keep track of your already retrieved files.

//-

WARNING: Wirecard stores the old copies of your processed batch files on the
Wirecard file server for up to 3 months. After that time period they
will be deleted automatically. It is at your discretion to
use this file repository.

[#BatchProcessingApi_ProcessingTime]
==== Processing Time

Processing of batch files begins at 8:00 am CET. Each customer's file
will be picked up and processed individually. Processing time may vary
depending on the number of customers using this service.

The response file will be available in the subfolder
``to<foldername>/new`` for pick up as soon as the request file has been
fully processed.

[#BatchProcessingApi_URLandCredentials]
==== URL and Credentials

The URL and credentials for the SFTP Server must be provided prior to
production integration. Please contact <<ContactUs, Merchant Support>> if you
did not receive your credentials.

[#BatchProcessingApi_Files]
=== Files

[#BatchProcessingApi_Files_Specifications]
==== Specifications

Request and response files must meet the following criteria:

- Encrypted with PGP (mandatory for files including _Credit Card_
transactions)
- Formatted as ``.csv``
- This means, only comma (``,``) is accepted as separator!
+
IMPORTANT: A field value *must not* contain a comma!

+
- Linefeed: ``LF`` (Unix format) must be used as separator for the
different transactions
- Include header columns for each field
- Encoded in UTF-8
- The different parameters must be defined in the order given in the
table <<BatchProcessingApi_Request_Sepa, Batch Processing SEPA>>.

//-

Please refer to the <<BatchProcessingApi_Sample, Sample>> for Batch Processing.

[#BatchProcessingApi_Request]
===== Request

Batch processing has been designed to accept transactions for several
payment methods. Field requirements vary by different payment methods.

[#BatchProcessingApi_Request_CreditCard]
====== _Credit Card_

The <<BatchProcessingApi_Fields_CreditCard, _Credit Card_ Fields table>>
describes the fields that must be provided for _Credit Card_ transaction requests.

- The fields must be defined in the ``.csv`` file in the order given in the
following table to allow correct processing.
- CSV format requires that each field must be specified. Empty fields
(optional fields or fields not used by _Credit Card_) have to be defined
as empty values separated by commas: ``,,``.

//-

.Example
----
…3.33,EUR,4012000300001003,…
----

WARNING: Batch processing for _Credit Card_ does not support submitting the CVV/CVC.
+
To process _Credit Card_ transactions via batch, it is recommended to
first submit an online _authorization_ transaction via API and follow-up
with a _capture_ transaction via batch. A _capture_ must be submitted
with a parent-Transaction ID referring to a successful _authorization_
transaction.
+
Please refer to <<CreditCard, _Credit Card_>> for more information. The names
used in the batch service may differ from the field names given in the API
documentation. For details see the
<<BatchProcessingApi_FieldNameMapping, Batch API Field Name Mapping>> table.

[#BatchProcessingApi_Request_Sepa]
====== SEPA

Batch processing has been designed to accept transactions for several
payment methods. Field requirements vary by different payment methods.

The <<BatchProcessingApi_Fields_Sepa, Batch API SEPA Fields Table>> describes
the fields that must be provided for SEPA transaction requests.

- The fields must be defined in the ``.csv`` file in the order given in the
following table to allow correct processing.
- CSV format requires that each field must be specified. Empty fields
(optional fields or fields not used by SEPA) have to be defined as empty
values separated by commas: ``,,``.

//-

.Example
----
 …121.22,EUR,,DE42512308000000060004,…
----

Please refer to <<SEPADirectDebit, SEPA DD>> and <<SEPACreditTransfer, SEPA CT>>
for more information. The names used in the batch service may
differ from the field names given in the API documentation. For details
see the <<BatchProcessingApi_FieldNameMapping, Batch API Field Name Mapping>>
table.

[#BatchProcessingApi_Request_FileNaming]
====== Request File Naming

Request files must be given a unique batch ID using the following
format:

``requestbatchid.timestamp.request.csv.pgp``

.Example
----
batchsample001.201201011801.*request*.csv.pgp
----

- Where timestamp is in the format of ``YYYYMMDDhhmm`` and in UTC timezone.
- The request batch ID will be included in the response filename and
within the response file content.
- PGP encryption is optional.

//-

WARNING: If the file is encrypted, the extension ``.pgp`` must be added to the file
name!

[#BatchProcessingApi_Response]
===== Response

[#BatchProcessingApi_Response_FileNaming]
====== Response File Naming

Response files will be named after the request file including the
request batch ID, timestamp and customer number:

``requestbatchid.timestamp.<foldername>.response.csv.pgp``

.Meaning
- Extension ``.pgp`` will only be added if PGP encryption was requested.
- ``<foldername>`` is the merchants' number (SFTP User), eg: ``C0001``

//-

.Example
- Request file: ``batchsample001.201201011801.request.csv.pgp``
- Corresponding response file: ``batchsample001.201201011801.C0001.response.csv.pgp``

[#PPv2_Seamless_NVP]
== Merchants Integrated with NVP (Seamless Mode)

Merchants who integrated the previous payment page using NVP can also
use seamless mode, with a few changes of function names. The integration
is otherwise identical to the JSON version.

*1. Update the ``paymentPageLoader`` JavaScript library in your ``<head>`` HTML code with the new ``paymentPage.js``:*

[source,html,subs=attributes+]
----
<script src="https://{pp-test-instance-hostname}/loader/paymentPage.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
----

*2. Use the NVP version of the "render" function:*

[source,js,subs=attributes+]
----
{payment-page-function-short}.seamlessRender({
  url: "{payment-redirect-url}", // this is the payment link returned in response to your initial api/payment/register request from step 1
  wrappingDivId: "seamless-form-target",
  onSuccess: function (response) {
    // called when seamless form is successfully rendered
  },
  onError: function (errResp) {
    // called if seamless form failed to render
  }
});
----

*3. The "submit" function is the same for both types:*

[source,js,subs=attributes+]
----
{payment-page-function-short}.seamlessSubmit({
  onSuccess: function (response) {
  // called when seamless form data is successfully submitted
  },
  onError: function (response) {
  //called when data submission fails
  }
});
----

Naturally, you do not send a backend request at the beginning with NVP,
instead you include all the payment information inside
``requestData`` like in your old integration.

[#MultiPaymentApi_RetrieveMultiPayments]
=== Retrieve Multi Payments

With the query request function, the merchant can obtain information
about the status of a multi payment transaction and the payments within.

You can retrieve multi payment transactions via two different ways:
either by ``multi-payment-id`` or by ``multi-payment-request-id``.

[#MultiPaymentApi_RetrieveByPaymentId]
==== By multi-payment-id

Retrieving a multi payment transaction using a ``multi-payment-id`` returns
a single multi payment belonging to a merchant resolver. The
``multi-payment-id`` node must match the value that was included in the
multi payment response. An error is returned if the ``multi-payment-id`` is
not available or the requested user is not authorized to see the
content. The desired content type can be set through the Accept header
or by specifying an extension.

[#MultiPaymentApi_RetrieveByRequestId]
==== By multi-payment-request-id

Retrieving a multi payment transaction using a ``multi-payment-request-id`` returns
a single multi payment belonging to a merchant resolver. The
``multi-payment-request-id`` node must match the value that was included in the
multi payment response. An error is returned if the ``multi-payment-request-id`` is
not available or the requested user is not authorized to see the
content. The desired content type can be set through the Accept header
or by specifying an extension.

[#MultiPaymentApi_Workflow]
=== Workflow

image::images/06-00-multi-payment-api/transaction-brace.png[Multipayments Workflow]

First, the _Multi Payment API_ validates the incoming
multi payment request. This validation includes

- Verification of the payment request XML
- Check if transaction type is configured for the merchant
- Check if payment method is configured for the merchant
- Check if transaction type and payment method combination is supported by
the _Multi Payment API_

//-

IMPORTANT: If the validation fails, the entire transaction will be declined.

After successful validation of a payment request, the _Multi Payment API_
generates individual payment requests based on the multi payment request.

- For each payment request, a mapped transaction type for the payment
provider is chosen.
- If the mapped transaction type is ``skip``, the _Multi Payment API_ does
not process that particular payment request.
- The individual payments are processed in order of priority:
. The voucher payment requests are processed first.
. Financial payment requests are processed last.

//-

The _Multi Payment API_ sends the individual payment request to the
respective payment provider.

For any unsuccessful payment response, the _Multi Payment API_ rolls
back the previously successfully processed payments.

The pending payment requests are not submitted.

WARNING: _EPS_ transactions cannot be rolled back.

Finally, a multi payment response is built with a collective status
and status of the individual payments.

This response is then sent to merchant.

[#FraudPrevention_AVS]
=== Address Verification System

Each card scheme maintain an own set of return codes. To facilitate the
implementation Wirecard maps those codes to a uniformed set of scheme
independent response codes.

[#FraudPrevention_AVS_PaymentResponse]
==== AVS in Payment Response

If merchant's Wirecard provider account is configured to store AVS data
(``connector.avs.data.store=true``) the AVS result is returned as additional
part in the payment response and notification.

[#FraudPrevention_AVS_WirecardResponseCodes]
==== Wirecard Response Codes

The following table outlines the set of codes used by Wirecard. This
uniformed codes should be the preferred source for decisions related to AVS.

[cols="4,4,9"]

| Response Code | Message         | Description

| 0             | Reserved        | Reserved.
| F             | Exact Match     | Street address and zip code match.
| P             | Partial Match   | Either street address or zip codes do not match.
| U             | AVS unavailable | Address information is unavailable or the Issuer does not support AVS.
| E             | Error           | AVS not performed due to an error or insufficient data.
| N             | No Match        | Neither address nor zip code match.

[#FraudPrevention_AVS_AuthorizationEntity]
==== Authorization Entity

The Authorization Entity defines the party responding to the AVS Request.

[cols="4,13"]

| Authorization Entity | Message

| 2                    | Response provided by Intermediate processor.
| 5                    | Response provided by issuer processor.

[#FraudPrevention_AVS_ProviderResponseCode]
==== Provider Response Code

The Provider Response Code is the code returned from the provider. If
the business case was activated for AVS the code it is returned together
in the response, together with the human readable Provider Response
Message. The following table lists the current set of codes used by the
card schemes and outlines the mapping between the Provider Response Code
and the unified Wirecard Response Code. Please note that the actual
Provider Response Code depends on the actual used provider and could be
also changed and extended by the provider.
So it may differ from the table below. Therefore Wirecard recommends the
preferred usage of the Wirecard Response Code.

[#FraudPrevention_DeviceFingerprinting]
=== Device Fingerprint

[#FraudPrevention_DeviceFingerprint_Integration]
==== Integration

In order to integrate Wirecard's _Device Fingerprint (FPS)_ with your
website, you need to insert _Profiling Tags_ on web pages where you will
profile consumer's devices. You can either insert the tags directly into
your website, or use our iframe service to embed the tags within an
iframe.

_Profiling Tags_ are placed on HTML pages served by your web
application, and allow Wirecard to collect device information from the
consumer's browser. You need to identify pages in your web application
in which to place the tags that ensures that their devices are profiled
before submitting a transaction.

[#FraudPrevention_DeviceFingerprint_Sample]
===== HTML Sample for Profiling Tags

.Profiling Tags
[source,html]
----
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://h.wirecard.com/fp/tags.js?org_id=6xxznhva&session_id=session_id"></script>
<noscript>
   <iframe style="width: 100px; height: 100px; border: 0; position: absolute; top: -5000px;" src="https://h.wirecard.com/tags?org_id=6xxznhva&session_id=session_id"></iframe>
</noscript>
----

The ``org_id`` is fix for all merchants: value is ``6xxznhva``.

The ``session_id`` is a temporary identifier that is unique to the
consumer's session.

- It must be 10 to 128 characters long.
- The following characters are allowed: upper and lower case English letters, 
digits, underscore, hyphen (``[a-zA-Z0-9_-]``)
- Recommended format: ``<merchant_id>_<random_string>``
  * ``merchant_id``: Merchant Account ID (MAID) or Merchant Account Resolver Category
  * ``random_string``: generated by the merchant
- Example of ``session_id``: +
  ``9105bb4f-ae68-4768-9c3b-3eda968f57ea_2019-01-01_085310001_123456`` +
  (``MAID_date_time_number``) 

//- 

NOTE: The ``session_id`` must be unique for at least 30 minutes, otherwise existing device information 
will be overwritten. 

As a final optional consideration you may want to remove the reference
to ``\http://h.wirecard.com`` and set up web server
redirection instead to avoid placing a third-party domain name inside
your HTML.

For this you will need to set up a DNS entry for your sub-domain that
redirects to ``\http://h.wirecard.com`` and give your
certificate to Wirecard to be placed on the device identification
server.

NOTE: Creating separate certificates will cause additional costs.

[#FraudPrevention_DeviceFingerprint_Transmit]
==== Transmit to {payment-gateway-abbr}

To use the _Device Fingerprint_ the ``session_id`` (generated as above)
has to be transmitted with the payment transaction to the {payment-gateway}.

The {payment-gateway} provides the field ``device/fingerprint``
for this process. For details see the <<RestApi_Fields, REST API Fields>> list.

[#FraudPrevention_FPS]
=== Wirecard Fraud Prevention Suite

Fraud is one of the major threats to turnover and revenue for every
online merchant. By using fraud prevention methods every merchant is
able to participate and benefit from the still growing online market.
The Wirecard Fraud Prevention Suite (FPS) helps to identify fraud early
in the sales process and to prevent it before it happens. FPS checks
every incoming transaction using a complex set of rules. By using this
rule set, the merchant will benefit from the experience of other
merchants in the market segment incorporated into the rules.

[#FraudPrevention_FPS_CreditCardRiskFraud]
==== Credit Card Check

The {payment-gateway} has a built-in functionality to perform
risk check before processing the credit card payment if configured for
the certain merchant account. This usually includes fraud check using
Wirecard Fraud Prevention Suite (FPS) solution. The result of the risk
check can be a rejection/approval of the payment transaction or an FPS
case which needs to be resolved manually using the FPS merchant cockpit.

There are 2 scenarios in the credit card payment processing where the
FPS check is involved.

image::images/12-fraud-prevention/risk_and_fraud_check.png[Workflow of Risk and Fraud Check]

[#FraudPrevention_FPS_CreditCardRiskFraud_Ecommerce]
===== Transaction processing in E-Commerce mode

. The merchant sends an _authorization_, _authorization-only_,
_final-authorization_, _preauthorization_ or _purchase_ payment transaction
request.
. The system performs a risk/FPS check.

//-

* The risk/FPS check results in a rejection:
.. the corresponding credit card payment transaction is declined.
.. the transaction state in the response is set to ``failed``.
.. a corresponding status code is returned (for details please see
<<StatusCodes, Transaction Status Codes>>).

* The risk/FPS check results in an approval:
.. the payment transaction is processed.

//-

If the system needs to create a case according to FPS rules, the
corresponding payment transaction will be executed. Depending on the
outcome of the payment transaction the following scenarios are possible:


* The payment transaction is successful
.. The system creates a case in FPS.
.. FPS adds the status code ``100.0101 "FPS case created"``.
.. The system returns a response (The merchant usually needs to put the
order process on hold and perform a manual check of the created case
using the FPS merchant cockpit portal).
.. The merchant resolves the case (FPS notifies the merchant via a
technical XML notification sent to the special endpoint in the merchant
system and the order process can continue).

//-

* The payment transaction has failed
.. The system does not create a case in FPS.
.. The system returns the corresponding error status code with the response.

//-

[#FraudPrevention_FPS_CreditCardRiskFraud_3DS]
===== Using 3D Secure
. Merchant sends a check-enrollment request.
. The system performs a risk/FPS check (similar to e-commerce transaction).

//-

* The risk/FPS check results in a rejection:

.. The system declines the check enrollment transaction.
.. The system sets the transaction state in the response to ``failed``.
.. The system returns a corresponding status code (for details please see
<<StatusCodes, Transaction Status Codes>>).

//-

* The risk/FPS check results in an approval:

.. The system performs the enrollment check. If a case needs to be
created according to FPS rules, the system performs the enrollment
check.

//-

NOTE: No corresponding status code will be added to the check enrollment
response.

Based on the outcome of the previous enrollment check, the system
executes an authorization or purchase transaction.

NOTE: The following _authorization_ or _purchase_ transaction will be executed
without a new FPS check.

* The authorization or purchase transaction is successful:

.. The system creates a case in FPS.
.. FPS adds the status code ``100.0101 "FPS case created"``.
.. The system returns the response.
.. The merchant puts the order process on hold.
.. The merchant (or a dedicated Wirecard team) performs a manual check
of the created case using the FPS merchant cockpit portal.
.. The merchant (or a dedicated Wirecard team) resolves the case.
.. FPS notifies the merchant via a technical XML notification
(FPS sends it to the special endpoint in the merchant system).
.. The order process can continue.

//-

* The authorization or purchase transaction has failed:

.. FPS does not create a case.
.. The system returns the corresponding error status code with the response.

//-

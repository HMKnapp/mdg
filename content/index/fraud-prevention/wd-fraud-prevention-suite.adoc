== Wirecard Fraud Prevention Suite

Fraud is one of the major threats to turnover and revenue for every
online merchant. By using fraud prevention methods every merchant is
able to participate and benefit from the still growing online market.
The Wirecard Fraud Prevention Suite (FPS) helps to identify fraud early
in the sales process and to prevent it before it happens. FPS checks
every incoming transaction using a complex set of rules. By using this
rule set, the merchant will benefit from the experience of other
merchants in the market segment incorporated into the rules.

=== Credit Card Check

The {payment-gateway} has a built-in functionality to perform
risk check before processing the credit card payment if configured for
the certain merchant account. This usually includes fraud check using
Wirecard Fraud Prevention Suite (FPS) solution. The result of the risk
check can be a rejection/approval of the payment transaction or an FPS
case which needs to be resolved manually using the FPS merchant cockpit.

There are 2 scenarios in the credit card payment processing where the
FPS check is involved.

[#FraudPrevention_FPS_CreditCardRiskFraud_Ecommerce]
==== Transaction processing in E-Commerce mode

. The merchant sends an _authorization_, _authorization-only_,
_final-authorization_, _preauthorization_ or _purchase_ payment transaction
request.
. The system performs a risk/FPS check.

//-

* The risk/FPS check results in a rejection:
.. the corresponding credit card payment transaction is declined.
.. the transaction state in the response is set to ``failed``.
.. a corresponding status code is returned (for details please see
<<StatusCodes, Transaction Status Codes>>).

* The risk/FPS check results in an approval:
.. the payment transaction is processed.

//-

If the system needs to create a case according to FPS rules, the
corresponding payment transaction will be executed. Depending on the
outcome of the payment transaction the following scenarios are possible:


* The payment transaction is successful
.. The system creates a case in FPS.
.. FPS adds the status code ``100.0101 "FPS case created"``.
.. The system returns a response (The merchant usually needs to put the
order process on hold and perform a manual check of the created case
using the FPS merchant cockpit portal).
.. The merchant resolves the case (FPS notifies the merchant via a
technical XML notification sent to the special endpoint in the merchant
system and the order process can continue).

//-

* The payment transaction has failed
.. The system does not create a case in FPS.
.. The system returns the corresponding error status code with the response.

//-

==== Using 3D Secure
. Merchant sends a check-enrollment request.
. The system performs a risk/FPS check (similar to e-commerce transaction).

//-

* The risk/FPS check results in a rejection:

.. The system declines the check enrollment transaction.
.. The system sets the transaction state in the response to ``failed``.
.. The system returns a corresponding status code (for details please see
<<StatusCodes, Transaction Status Codes>>).

//-

* The risk/FPS check results in an approval:

.. The system performs the enrollment check. If a case needs to be
created according to FPS rules, the system performs the enrollment
check.

//-

NOTE: No corresponding status code will be added to the check enrollment
response.

Based on the outcome of the previous enrollment check, the system
executes an authorization or purchase transaction.

NOTE: The following _authorization_ or _purchase_ transaction will be executed
without a new FPS check.

* The authorization or purchase transaction is successful:

.. The system creates a case in FPS.
.. FPS adds the status code ``100.0101 "FPS case created"``.
.. The system returns the response.
.. The merchant puts the order process on hold.
.. The merchant (or a dedicated Wirecard team) performs a manual check
of the created case using the FPS merchant cockpit portal.
.. The merchant (or a dedicated Wirecard team) resolves the case.
.. FPS notifies the merchant via a technical XML notification
(FPS sends it to the special endpoint in the merchant system).
.. The order process can continue.

//-

* The authorization or purchase transaction has failed:

.. FPS does not create a case.
.. The system returns the corresponding error status code with the response.

//-

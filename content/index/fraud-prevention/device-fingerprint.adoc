[#FraudPrevention_DeviceFingerprint_Integration]
=== Integration

In order to integrate Wirecard's _Device Fingerprint (FPS)_ with your
website, you need to insert _Profiling Tags_ on web pages where you will
profile consumer's devices. You can either insert the tags directly into
your website, or use our iframe service to embed the tags within an
iframe.

_Profiling Tags_ are placed on HTML pages served by your web
application, and allow Wirecard to collect device information from the
consumer's browser. You need to identify pages in your web application
in which to place the tags that ensures that their devices are profiled
before submitting a transaction.

[#FraudPrevention_DeviceFingerprint_Sample]
==== HTML Sample for Profiling Tags

.Profiling Tags
[source,html]
----
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://h.wirecard.com/fp/tags.js?org_id=6xxznhva&session_id=session_id"></script>
<noscript>
   <iframe style="width: 100px; height: 100px; border: 0; position: absolute; top: -5000px;" src="https://h.wirecard.com/tags?org_id=6xxznhva&session_id=session_id"></iframe>
</noscript>
----

The ``org_id`` is fix for all merchants: value is ``6xxznhva``.

The ``session_id`` is a temporary identifier that is unique to the
consumer's session.

- It must be 10 to 128 characters long.
- The following characters are allowed: upper and lower case English letters, 
digits, underscore, hyphen (``[a-zA-Z0-9_-]``)
- Recommended format: ``<merchant_id>_<random_string>``
  * ``merchant_id``: Merchant Account ID (MAID) or Merchant Account Resolver Category
  * ``random_string``: generated by the merchant
- Example of ``session_id``: +
  ``9105bb4f-ae68-4768-9c3b-3eda968f57ea_2019-01-01_085310001_123456`` +
  (``MAID_date_time_number``) 

//- 

NOTE: The ``session_id`` must be unique for at least 30 minutes, otherwise existing device information 
will be overwritten. 

As a final optional consideration you may want to remove the reference
to ``\http://h.wirecard.com`` and set up web server
redirection instead to avoid placing a third-party domain name inside
your HTML.

For this you will need to set up a DNS entry for your sub-domain that
redirects to ``\http://h.wirecard.com`` and give your
certificate to Wirecard to be placed on the device identification
server.

NOTE: Creating separate certificates will cause additional costs.

[#FraudPrevention_DeviceFingerprint_Transmit]
=== Transmit to {payment-gateway-abbr}

To use the _Device Fingerprint_ the ``session_id`` (generated as above)
has to be transmitted with the payment transaction to the {payment-gateway}.

The {payment-gateway} provides the field ``device/fingerprint``
for this process. For details see the <<RestApi_Fields, REST API Fields>> list.

== Address Verification System

The Address Verification System (AVS) verifies credit card data. It compares the billing address sent in the transaction with the issuer's billing information of the cardholder. +
You can use AVS if your {payment-provider-name} provider account is configured ``connector.avs.data.store=true``. +
For details contact <<ContactUs, Merchant Support>>.

If AVS is active, you either process the response codes stand-alone or you combine AVS with the {payment-provider-name} Fraud Prevention Suite (FPS). FPS, then, offers the possibility to react to specific AVS response codes.

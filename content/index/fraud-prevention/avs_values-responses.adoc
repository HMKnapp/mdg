[#FraudPrevention_AVS_ValueResponse]
== AVS Values and Responses

Each card scheme maintains an own set of response codes. To facilitate the implementation {payment-provider-name} maps those codes to a uniform set of scheme independent response codes.

[#FraudPrevention_AVS_SchemeResponseCode]
=== Card Scheme's Response Codes

The card scheme returns a response code, together with a human readable response message. The following tables list the current set of codes which the card schemes use. The tables map the card scheme's response code with the uniform {payment-provider-name} response code. 

NOTE: Each card scheme can change or extend the response code list. It may differ from the table below. {payment-provider-name} recommends to preferably use the uniform <<FraudPrevention_AVS_{payment-provider-name}ResponseCodes, {payment-provider-name} response code>>.

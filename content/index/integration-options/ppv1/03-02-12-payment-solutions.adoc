[#PPv1_PaymentSolutions_PaybyLink]
=== Pay by Link

Merchants can offer payment on Hosted Payment Page (HPP) using a <<PPv1_PaymentSolutions_InvoiceviaEmail, hyperlink from their own newsletter or an email>>.
The hyperlink redirects the consumer to a credit card
form within HPP in order to supply consumer's card data. Additionally,
the merchant can accept MOTO (Mail Order/Telephone Order) payments and
remain PCI SAQ-A compliant. Pay by Link can also be used with the
<<PPv2_Features_PaybyLink, {payment-page-v2-abbr}>> integration.

[#PPV1_PaymentSolutions_PaybyLink_Hyperlink]
==== Hyperlink Expiration Timestamp

Merchant can offer payment on Hosted Payment Page (HPP) which has been
provided by hyperlink functionality for custom limited time by sending
``hyperlink_expiration_time_stamp`` in request. Timestamp is in ISO 8601
format consisting of combined date and time in UTC:
YY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSÂ±HH:MM.

[#PPv1_PaymentSolutions_PaybyLink_Hyperlink_HowTo]
.How-To

For XML and JSON Requests:

In order to generate payment link, send credit card payment request to
REST API, specifically ``paymentmethods`` endpoint without entering card
information. If request does not include all necessary parameters to
execute the payment, URL to HPP card form is returned in the response.
If request contains also optional ``hyperlink-expiration-time-stamp``
field, hyperlink will be valid until provided timestamp instead of
default value of 30 minutes.

For XML and JSON Responses:

The response contains the actual path stored at ``<payment-method url>``
which renders card payment form. This path needs to be copied to
customer.

minutes, then the request ID expires.

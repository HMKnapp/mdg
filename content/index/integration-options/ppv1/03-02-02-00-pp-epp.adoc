[#PP_EPP_Introduction]
=== Introduction

With this type of integration, the payment page is displayed in overlay
directly on the merchant's checkout page. Redirection is not needed to
select a payment method or to enter payment details. This type of
integration allows for a more comfortable consumer's experience. The
consumer feels as though the payment page is still an integral part of
the merchant's site.

The Embedded Payment Page (EPP) integration is the same as for the Hosted
Payment Page - it involves a (different) function call from the same
JavaScript library.

[#PPSolutions_PPv2_PPv2Security_Flow]
=== {payment-page-v2-abbr} Security Flow

All {payment-page-v2-abbr} integrations share a common backend-to-backend JSON
<<PPSolutions_PPv2_Workflow, workflow>> for the payment process:

[%autowidth]
|===
h|Payment Processing with HPP and EPP
a|.  Create a payment session (initial request).
  .  Redirect the consumer to the payment page (initial response URL).
  .  Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.

h|Payment Processing with _{payment-page-v1}_ image:images/icons/legacy.png[LEGACY, 80, 20, role="no-zoom", title="Development of this product is discontinued."] in Seamless Mode
a|.  Create a payment session (initial request).
  . Render the Seamless payment form in your checkout page (initial response URL).
  .  Submit the payment.
  .  Highly recommended: Parse and process the payment response.
|===

As part of this workflow:

- The initial request is secured by basic access authentication (basic
header with base64-encoded credentials).
- The final payment response is base64-encoded and signed by HMAC
SHA-256. This allows you to verify the authenticity of the final payment
response.

[#PPSolutions_PPv2_PPv2Security_ResponseVerification]
=== Response Verification

For {payment-page-v2-abbr}, response verification is optional but highly recommended.

Response verification requires:

- the Secret Key you receive during merchant configuration.
- the field entries ``response-base64``, ``response-signature-base64`` and ``response-signature-algorithm`` sent
as form data with the final payment response

//-

You can find the required form data included in the final payment
response sent to the redirect target in your shop.

[%autowidth]
|===
|Name | Description

|``response-signature-base64`` | Base64-encoded signature against which to verify the calculated security response signature.
|``response-signature-algorithm`` |"HmacSHA256" specifying the type of the message authentication code.
|``response-base64`` |Final response containing the payment data in a base64 encoded JSON format.
|===

*To verify the response*, calculate the security response signature and
check it against the signature data you receive with the final payment
response.

We provide ready-made response verification examples for Java, PHP and
C# below.

IMPORTANT: **If the response signature verification fails,** do not accept the
payment and contact <<ContactUs, Merchant Support>>.

[#PPSolutions_PPv2_PPv2Security_NVP]
=== Merchants Integrated with NVP

Requests in the legacy NVP format are secured by a HMAC SHA-256 (Sig.
v2) or SHA-256 (Sig. v1) signature. For merchants using this format,
signature calculation is mandatory. Based on which version you are
using, see the
<<PP_Security_SignatureV2, Signature v2>> or
<<PP_Security, Signature v1>> pages.

NOTE: The signature is only used with requests sent to the {payment-gateway} endpoint, e.g.
``\https://{pp-test-instance-hostname}/api/payment/``, using the legacy NVP format
( for returning merchants). +
This *does not* apply to the JSON flow.

====

Integrate the Hosted Payment Page (HPP) to redirect the consumer from
your shop to a standalone payment page hosted by {payment-provider-name}.

Use the <<PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_PaymentPageDesigner, Payment Page Designer>>
to customize the HPP interface: set background, colors, fonts, logos and
more for a cohesive look that meets your preferences and fits your
merchant branding. The redirect to the HPP will be barely noticeable,
which makes consumers feel at ease.

HPP also allows you to configure <<PPv2_Features_PaybyLinkAPI, expiration times>> for payment hyperlinks:
payments can be postponed.

{payment-provider-name} hosts all sensitive data - you only need to meet the
requirements of SAQ A to be fully PCI DSS compliant. With the HPP you
can focus on your business and stop worrying about data security.

Integrate the Embedded Payment Page (EPP) to display the payment form as
an overlay to the checkout page. The consumer stays on the same page
until the payment is finished, rather than being redirected to a
separate site. This creates a smooth, uninterrupted shopping experience.

Use the <<PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_PaymentPageDesigner, Payment Page Designer>> to customize the EPP interface: set colors, fonts, logos and
more for a cohesive look that meets your preferences and fits your
merchant branding.

{payment-provider-name} hosts all sensitive data - you only need to meet the
requirements of SAQ A to be fully PCI DSS compliant. With the EPP you
can focus on your business and stop worrying about data security.

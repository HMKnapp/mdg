Use Seamless Mode to display the {payment-page-v2-abbr} payment form as a fully integrated
part of your checkout page. Without redirects to external pages (except
for credit card 3D Secure verification), overlays, or pop-ups, the
payment form appears native to your website but is still being hosted by {payment-provider-name}.

Use the <<PaymentPageSolutions_PPv2_PaymentPageDesigner, Payment Page Designer>> to customize the payment form: set colors, fonts, logos and
more for a cohesive look that meets your preferences and fits your
merchant branding.

{payment-provider-name} hosts all sensitive data - you only need to meet the
requirements of SAQ A to be fully PCI DSS compliant. With Seamless Mode
you can focus on your business and stop worrying about data security.

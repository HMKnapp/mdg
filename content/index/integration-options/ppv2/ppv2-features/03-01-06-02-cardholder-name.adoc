== Cardholder Name
Some merchants prefer to use a single field instead of 'First Name' and
'Last Name'. As with order overview, you can set these options using a
single field in the request.

Add the ``cardholder`` field to the payment request and set it to the
desired value.

| wpp_options_cardholder

| Boolean
| ``names``
 ``cardholder``
 ``none``
| options (\{ })
| Indicates the type of name field(s) used in the payment form or if they are enabled at all.
|===

There are three options:

. *Show both the First name & the Last name field on the payment page:* +
Set the value of ``cardholder`` to ``names``. This is the *default* option,
so you do not need to do anything for this to happen unless you change
the default.
. *Show the Cardholder name field (instead of First name & Last name) on the payment page:* +
Set the value of ``cardholder`` to ``cardholder``.
. *Only show card information on the payment page (no names):* +
Set the value of ``cardholder`` to ``none``.

//-

Cardholder name renders the value from the ``last-name`` field; i.e. if
you send the example request below with ``cardholder`` set to
``cardholder``, only "Doe" shows.

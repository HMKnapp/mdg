== Pay by Link via API
{payment-page-v2-abbr} offers the option to configure the expiration time & date of a
payment URL (``payment-redirect-url``). By adding
the ``hyperlink-expiration-time-stamp`` field to a normal payment request,
you can set the time & date when the payment URL expires: This allows
for using such URLs in different scenarios than instant payment, e.g.
sending the payment URL as a part of a newsletter/email, MOTO (Mail
Order/Telephone Order) payments, etc.

*The maximum allowed value is one
month in the future*, e.g. if the link is created on 01/05/2020, the latest date for
the expiration stamp is 01/06/2020.

NOTE: You can use Pay by Link via API with credit card payments or alternative payment
methods; both are supported.

Payment links with an expiration stamp redirect to a Hosted Payment
Page. You remain fully PCI SAQ-A compliant using these links.

[NOTE]
.To set the expiration stamp for a payment link:
====
Add the ``hyperlink-expiration-time-stamp`` field to the payment request
and set its value to the desired time & date.
====

request, you set the expiration time & date for the payment URL (default value is 30 minutes).
* Each payment hyperlink can only be used once.
* Specify redirect URLs in the request if you need to redirect your
customers to a different page than your database defaults (or you have
no defaults set). See
the <<PPSolutions_PPv2_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring the Redirect Pages>> section for more details
* The stamp uses ISO 8601 format with timezone,
e.g. ``2018-06-22T10:15:30+01:00``.
* The latest date for the expiration stamp is one month from the initial
request creation.

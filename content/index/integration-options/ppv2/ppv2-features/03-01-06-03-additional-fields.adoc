To show these fields in the form, you have two options:

[#PPv2_Features_AdditionalFields_FieldTogglesinPaymentPageDesigner]
=== Field Toggles in Payment Page Designer

Click the button(s) of the field you want to show in the Designer menu,
then save the theme. {payment-page-v2-abbr} then shows the saved field selection each time
it loads a payment page with that theme.

[#PPv2_Features_AdditionalFields_CustomCSSFeature]
=== Using the Custom CSS Feature in Payment Page Designer

Add the CSS class of the field you want to show to the *Payment Page Designer Custom
CSS Editor* and set its ``display`` property to ``block``.

For example:

[source,CSS,subs=attributes+]
----
.pp-cc-address1 {
    display: block;
 }

 .pp-cc-city {
    display: block;
 }
----

Since the default value of ``display`` property for these fields
is ``none``, as soon as you change it to ``block`` they become visible.
These CSS settings are a part of the theme and are loaded at any time
that you use that particular theme.

Here is a list of the CSS element names for the hidden fields:

[source,CSS,subs=attributes+]
----
.pp-cc-email
.pp-cc-phone
.pp-cc-address1
.pp-cc-address2
.pp-cc-city
.pp-cc-state
.pp-cc-country
.pp-cc-postal-code
----

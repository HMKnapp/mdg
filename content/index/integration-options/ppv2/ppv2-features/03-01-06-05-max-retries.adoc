== Max Retries

image::images/03-01-06-05-max-retries/MaxRetries.png[Max Retries, width=350, float="right"]

The Max Retries feature allows consumers to try and resubmit the payment
again if it fails. It works with all payment methods.

[TIP]
.An example situation:
====
A consumer attempts to pay with their credit card,
but the payment fails.

Payment page prompts the consumer whether they would like to retry the
payment. They can resubmit the card information or select a different
payment method altogether (depending on the configuration).
====

[NOTE]
.To enable Max Retries for a transaction:
====
Add the ``max-retries`` field to the payment request and set it to the
desired value.

=== Configuring Max Retries

The rules for configuring Max Retries are simple:

* If the value is *less than 0*, consumers have unlimited retries for
failed payments.
* If the value is *exactly 0*, consumers cannot retry payments: They are
redirected to the ``fail-redirect-url`` page immediately.
* If the value is *greater than 0*, that same value is the number of
retries allowed; e.g. if ``max-retries`` value is ``2``, consumers are
redirected to the ``fail-redirect-url`` only after two unsuccessful
attempts.
* Max Retries is disabled by default.

[#API_PBBA_Integrate_BrandIntegrateWeb_ThePaymethod]
.The _Pay_ method - for Successful _Request To Pay_ Response

When merchants want to post _Request To Pay_, they need to call the

``merchantRequestToPayResponseObject.secureToken`` is a unique token that
identifies a _Request To Pay_. It maps to:

|===
|Term |Request |Response |Notification |Type |Size |Description

|custom-field/[@zapp.inout.ApTRId] | |M |M |String |  |The human

Mandatory (M), Optional (O) or conditional \(C).

.Example

<custom-field field-name=``zapp.out.BRN`` field-value=``FRPSXS``/>

``merchantRequestToPayResponseObject.retrievalTimeOutPeriod`` specifies the
time window from the generation of _PBBA_ ``Code/secureToken`` to the
expiry of _PBBA_ ``Code/secureToken``, this is used by the ``get status``
(<<API_PBBA_Integrate_BrandIntegrateWeb_TheNotifymethod, _Notify_ method>>)
polling engine. It maps to:

|===
|Term |Request |Response |Notification |Type |Size |Description

|custom-field/[@zapp.out.RtrvlExpiryTimeIntrvl] | |O |O |Number |  |The
retrieval is the time taken from when the consumer hits the _Merchant_
button and sees the transaction within their banking app.

sent out to consumer. The popup component of the button shows the appropriate
popup, based on this flag. It maps to:

|===
|Term |Request |Response |Notification |Type |Size |Description

|custom-field/[@zapp.out.CookieStatus] |M |M |C |String |  |Cookie status for
_Payconnect_ services indicates, if the cookie is valid and active. Value can be

When a transaction is confirmed/declined by the consumer, merchants
receive a <<API_PaybyBankapp_Samples, payment notification>>.

If you want to use the _Notify_ method, you must map the _PBBA_
``merchantGetPaymentStatusObject`` elements to the
{payment-gateway}.

``merchantGetPaymentStatusObject.payConnectID`` is used in the _PayConnect_

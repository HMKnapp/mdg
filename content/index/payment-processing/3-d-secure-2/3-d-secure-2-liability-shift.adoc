[#3DSecureLiabilityShift]
== Liability Shift Rules

Generally, the liability shift rules for 3D Secure 2 are comparable with those for 3D Secure 1: Whenever a merchant successfully requests authentication from an issuer, the chargeback liability shifts to the issuer.

There are, however, some exceptions applicable within the European Economic Area (EEA) where Strong Customer Authentication is mandatory: 

- If an <<CreditCard_PSD2_SCA_Exemptions, exemption>> is applied by merchants and their acquirer (e.g. the merchant decides to avoid a challenge), the liability generally remains with the merchant.

- If an issuer does not support 3D Secure 2 after SCA requirements have come into effect in September 2019, there are cases where only attempting to apply 3D Secure 2 will lead to a shift in liability.

[#API_CC_3DS2_UseCases_CIOneClickCheckout]
== One-Click Checkout

For one-click checkout transactions, merchants store the consumer's card details (as a token) for future transactions. If the consumer wants to buy goods at a later point in time, they can do so without having to re-enter their card details.

Card details can be either stored <<API_CC_3DS2_UseCases_CIOneClickCheckout_IndependentOfPayment, independently of a payment>> or <<API_CC_3DS2_UseCases_CIOneClickCheckout_DuringPayment, during a payment>>.

. **Independent of payment:** A consumer creates an account with an online shop and provides their credit card details upon registration. At the moment of registration, no money is transferred.
. **During payment:** The credit card details are stored during the consumer's first checkout.

//-

WARNING: Before storing card details on file, consumers must be clearly informed how they will be used in the future. Obtain the consumers' consent.

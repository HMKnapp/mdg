=== 3D Secure 2.1 Frictionless Flow (Issuer supports 3D Secure 2)

image::images/16-05-appendix-f/3DSfrictionless.svg[3D Secure 2 Frictionless Workflow, align="center"]

*1.* *_Check-enrollment_*: This first step initiates the payment session and checks if the consumer’s card is enrolled in the 3D Secure 2 program. +
*1.1* Consumer (cardholder) checkout on your payment page. +
*1.2* Initiate the payment session with {payment-gateway} using the *check-enrollment* transaction type. Provide additional fields for 3D Secure 2 transactions. 3D Secure 2 fields can be found in the <<CreditCard_3DS2_Fields, 3D Secure 2 field table>> and are included in the <<Appendix_Xml, REST API payment XSD>>. +
*1.3* {payment-gateway} checks the 3D Secure version supported by the issuer with the 3D Secure server. +
*1.4* {payment-gateway} returns the *check-enrollment* response. It includes the *PAReq*, the ACS URL, and the 3D Secure version. +

*2.* _Redirect the consumer to the ACS URL_ +
*2.1* Send an HTTPS POST request including the ACS URL, the *<PAReq>*, the *<TermUrl>* and *<MD>*. +
*2.2* The ACS URL points to the public endpoint of the {payment-provider-name} 3D Secure Router which decodes the *<PAReq>*. +
*2.3* The {payment-provider-name} 3D Secure Router returns an HTML with the scheme logo and a "processing" screen which is displayed in the consumer's browser. +
*2.4* The {payment-provider-name} 3D Secure Router redirects the consumer to the 3DSMethodURL for device fingerprinting. +
*2.5* The Issuer ACS gathers the information and redirects the 3D Secure method completion information to the
{payment-provider-name} 3D Secure Router URL. +
*2.6* The {payment-provider-name} 3D Secure Router initiates authentication with the issuer's ACS via the scheme directory server. +
*2.7* The {payment-provider-name} 3D Secure Router posts the SSL-encrypted and digitally signed *PARes* (Payment Authentication response) to the *TermURL* via the consumer’s browser. +

*3.* *_Check-payer-response_* _(optional) and_ *_PARes_* _verification_: Use this request to receive, analyze and store authentication values on your side or use your connection to the {payment-gateway}.  The *check-payer-response* provides the authentication values needed later for completion of the payment transaction. It is executed _after_ you receive the *check-enrollment* response and the *PARes*. +
*3.1* Send a POST request with transaction type *check-payer-response* to {payment-gateway}. Provide the ``parent-transaction-id`` using the ``transaction-id`` from the *check-enrollment* response, and the *PARes*. +
*3.2* {payment-gateway} decodes the *PARes*, checks the signature and retrieves the final authentication values. +
*3.3* {payment-gateway} returns the final authentication values in the response of the *check-payer-response* transaction. These include the ``dsTransId``, ``CAAV/AVV``, ``ECI``, and ``authenticationStatus``. +


*4.* _Complete the payment transaction_: Proceed with the payment transaction with the relevant transaction-type (e.g. *authorization*, *purchase*, *authorization-only*). Use the final authentication values received either from the check-enrollment response(e.g. *PARes* and ``parent-transaction-id``), or from step 3.3 (*check-payer-response* response).

=== 3D Secure 2.1 Challenge Flow (Issuer supports 3D Secure 2)

*1.4* {payment-gateway} returns the *check-enrollment* response. It includes the *PAReq*, the ACS URL, and the 3D Secure version. +

*2.* _Redirect the consumer to the ACS URL_ +
*2.1* Send an HTTPS POST request including the ACS URL, the *<PAReq>*, the *<TermUrl>* and *<MD>*. +
*2.2* The ACS URL points to the public endpoint of the {payment-provider-name} 3D Secure Router which decodes the *<PAReq>*. +
*2.3* The {payment-provider-name} 3D Secure Router returns an HTML with the scheme logo and a "processing" screen which is displayed in the consumer's browser. +
*2.4* The {payment-provider-name} 3D Secure Router redirects the consumer to the 3DSMethodURL for device fingerprinting. +
*2.5* The Issuer ACS gathers the information and redirects the 3D Secure method completion information to the
{payment-provider-name} 3D Secure Router URL. +
*2.6* The {payment-provider-name} 3D Secure Router initiates authentication with the issuer's ACS via the scheme directory server. +
*2.7* The {payment-provider-name} 3D Secure Router redirects the consumer to the ACS which displays a challenge window (either a page or an iframe). +
*2.8* The consumer enters their data. After successful authentication, the ACS sends the challenge response to the {payment-provider-name} 3D Secure Router. +
*2.9* The {payment-provider-name} 3D Secure Router posts the SSL-encrypted and digitally signed *PARes* (Payment Authentication response) to the *TermURL* via the consumer’s browser. +

*3.2* {payment-gateway} decodes the *PARes*, checks the signature and retrieves the final authentication values. +
*3.3* {payment-gateway} returns the final authentication values in the response of the *check-payer-response* transaction. These include the ``dsTransId``, ``CAAV/AVV``, ``ECI``, and ``authenticationStatus``. +

=== 3D Secure 2.1 Flow with Fallback to 3D Secure 1 (Issuer does not support 3D Secure 2)

image::images/16-05-appendix-f/3DSfallback.svg[3D Secure 2 Fallback Workflow, align="center"]

*1.* *_Check-enrollment_*: This first step initiates the payment session and checks if the consumer’s card is enrolled in the 3D Secure 2 program. +
*1.1* Consumer (cardholder) checkout on your payment page. +
*1.2* Initiate the payment session with {payment-gateway} using the *check-enrollment* transaction type. Provide additional fields for 3D Secure 2 transactions. 3D Secure 2 fields can be found in the <<CreditCard_3DS2_Fields, 3D Secure 2 field table>> and are included in the <<Appendix_Xml, REST API payment XSD>>. +
*1.3* {payment-gateway} checks the 3D Secure version supported by the issuer with the 3D Secure server. If 3D Secure 2 is not supported then the 3D Secure server initiates the fallback to version 1 via the 3D Secure MPI. +
*1.4* {payment-gateway} returns the *check-enrollment* response. It includes the *PAReq*, the ACS URL, and the 3D Secure version. +

*2.* _Redirect the consumer to the ACS URL_ +
*2.1* Send an HTTPS POST request including the ACS URL, the *<PAReq>*, the *<TermUrl>* and *<MD>*. +
*2.2* The ACS URL points to the public endpoint of the issuer ACS, which decodes the *<PAReq>*. The ACS displays the authentication window for the cardholder. +
*2.3* The consumer enters their data in the authentication window displayed by the ACS. +
*2.4* The issuer ACS verifies the authentication credentials and posts the SSL-encrypted and digitally signed *PARes* (Payment Authentication response), as well as the *<MD>* to the *TermURL* via the consumer’s browser. +

*3.* *_Check-payer-response_* _(optional) and_ *_PARes_* _verification_: Use this request to receive, analyze and store authentication values on your side or use your connection to the {payment-gateway}.  The *check-payer-response* provides the authentication values needed later for completion of the payment transaction.

*3.1* Send a POST request with transaction type *check-payer-response* to {payment-gateway}. Provide the ``parent-transaction-id`` using the ``transaction-id`` from the *check-enrollment* response, and the *PARes*. +
*3.2* {payment-gateway} verifies the *PARes* with the 3D Secure MPI and receives the final authentication values. +
*3.3* {payment-gateway} returns the final authentication values in the response of the *check-payer-response* transaction. These include the ``XID``, ``CAAV/AVV``, ``ECI``, and ``authenticationStatus``. +

*4.* _Complete the payment transaction_: Proceed with the payment transaction with the relevant transaction-type (e.g. *authorization*, *purchase*, *authorization-only*). Use the final authentication values received either from the check-enrollment response (e.g. *PARes* and ``parent-transaction-id``), or from step 3.3 (*check-payer-response* response).

[#3DS2_Testing_SetUp]
=== Setup and Test Credentials

NOTE: Use these test credentials to test 3D Secure transactions for both versions, 3D Secure 2 as well as 3D Secure 1.

Use the following endpoint to set up your testing tool:

[cols="h,"]
|===
|URL (Endpoint) | ``\https://{rest-api-test-endpoint}``
|===

Refer to one of the following tables to complete your test credentials:

include::{root}/include/3-d-secure/3-d-secure_testcredentials_manual.adoc[]
include::{root}/include/3-d-secure/3-d-secure_testcredentials_automatic.adoc[]
include::{root}/include/3-d-secure/3-d-secure_testcredentials_nongamblingOCT.adoc[]

[#3DS2_Testing_TestCards]
=== Test Cards

We provide own test cards for each 3D Secure version, 3D Secure 2 and 3D Secure 1, as well as for a variety of card brands. These test cards allow you to trigger a certain behaviour when you send them to our endpoint. 

.Example
If you want to provoke the error status code ``500.1072`` ("_Card Not Enrolled_.")
in combination with a Visa card for a 3D Secure 1 transaction, use
_Card Number_ ``4012000300006002``, _Expiration Date_ ``{cc-exp-month}/{cc-exp-year}`` and _CVC_ ``002``.

[#3DS2_Testing_TestCards_3DSecure1]
==== 3D Secure 1 Transactions

For 3D Secure transactions, both 3D Secure 2 and 3D Secure 1,
{payment-gateway-abbr} usually checks with the first request, whether the card is enrolled in the 3D Secure program.
A card is enrolled in the 3D Secure program, if the response returns a positive enrollment
check and a positive authentication result.

[#3DS2_Testing_TestCards_3DSecure1_success]
.Card Numbers for Successful Transactions

With these card numbers you can provoke a successful response containing the
status code ``201.0000`` ("The resource was successfully created.").

[#3DS2_Testing_TestCards_3DSecure1_error]
.Card Numbers for Error Results

With these card numbers you can provoke an error response containing a variety of status codes.

|===


Detailed payment flows of all use cased included in these postman collection can be found <<CreditCard_3DS2_UseCases, here>>.

Use https://www.postman.com/postman[Postman] to run the collection. Need more information on how to use Postman to test our samples? Go to our <<3DS2_IntegrationGuide_REST_PostmanCollection, General Integration Guide for REST API>>.

NOTE: The postman collection is preconfigured with 3D (Manual Card Brand Recognition) test credentials and uses a Mastercard with the _Card Number_ ``5413330300201192``, _Expiration Date_ ``{cc-exp-month}/{cc-exp-year}`` and _CVC_ ``192``. This allows testing of a <<3DS2_worfklow_3DS2FF, frictionless payment flow>>.

== Installment Payment Plan (IPP)

**I**nstallment **P**ayment **P**lan is a feature that allows the consumer to pay in equal installments. +
Depending on the total order amount, you can offer various payment plans to the consumer. These IPPs differ in tenure and installment payment framework (e.g. interest rate). +
 +
Set up a contract with your issuing bank to agree on the IPP parameters. The issuing bank then provides {payment-provider-name} with these IPP parameters.

//-

NOTE: If your merchant account has not yet been set up for IPP, <<ContactUs, contact merchant support>>.

.IPP Characteristics
- *Fixed*: Installments are of equal amount.
- *On-us:* Issuing bank and acquiring bank are the same.
- *Issuer-based:* Post-clearing, you receive the full amount from the acquiring bank. The consumer pays their issuing bank (same entity as acquiring bank since *on-us*) in installments.
- *Domestic payments only:* The instrument country, i.e. the country where the
consumer's card was issued, must match the merchant country.
- *Domestic currency only:* The consumer can only pay in the local currency of the merchant country.
- *Credit card:* This feature is available for credit card payments only. +
_Supported card brands:_
+
* Mastercard
* Visa

=== Transaction Types
**I**nstallment **P**ayment **P**lan works with transaction type _purchase_.

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPP_Workflow]
[discrete]
//==== 1. Consumer has only one credit card
=== Workflow
. The consumer checks out products in the merchant's shop.
. The merchant's shop displays the payment form, where the consumer enters their credit card data (PAN).
. WPG checks the card's IPP eligibility by validating the card number against the BIN ranges activated at the issuing bank.
The BIN range is part of the contract between merchant and issuing bank. It lists all  **B**ank **I**dentification **N**umbers (the first 6 digits of credit card number) that qualify for installment payment.
//+
//The BIN range lists all **B**ank **I**dentification **N**umbers that qualify for installment payment.
+
WPG also checks if the transaction and the transaction currency are domestic.

* Validation fail: The consumer is redirected to the regular (credit card) payment form.
* Validation OK: The consumer can select either regular payment or payment in installments.
. The consumer selects "Payment in Installments".
. The merchant sends an <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPP_InstallmentCalculator, Installment Calculator>> request to WPG.
. WPG forwards the request to the issuing bank.
. The issuing bank generates a list of all available IPPs and sends it to the merchant.
. The merchant's shop displays the available installment plans to the consumer (on the checkout page).
. The consumer selects an installment plan and submits the payment. The selected program/tenure is sent with the _purchase_ request to WPG.
*Mandatory IPP fields* in this _purchase_ request are <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPP_Fields, __tenure__>> and <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_IPP_Fields, __program-id__>>.
. WPG forwards the request to the issuing bank.
. The issuing bank processes the request and sends the response to WPG.
. WPG forwards the response to the merchant.
. The merchant informs the consumer about the transaction outcome.
. The issuing bank pays the total order amount to the merchant.
. The consumer pays the issuing bank (same
  entity as acquiring bank since *on-us*) in installments.

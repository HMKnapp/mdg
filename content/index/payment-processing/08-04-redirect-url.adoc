[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_RedirectURL]
== Redirect-URL

A payment process needs a redirect-URL. If no redirect-URL is defined at
all, the transaction will not be processed.

The merchant can send a redirect URL in case of a successful, a
cancelled or a failed transaction. Depending on the result of the
transaction the consumer will be redirected to the corresponding page of
the merchant's environment.

The redirect-URLs can be configured either on MAID level or they can be
sent individually with each request.

When the merchant configures the redirect-URLs in the MAID, they don't
have to be present in the request. The redirect-URLs are automatically
loaded from the MAID configuration.

When the merchant determines the redirect-URLs in the request, the
request's redirect-URLs overwrite the MAID configuration for that
particular transaction.

The merchant can determine up to three different redirect-URLs in one request.
In that case the merchant can determine one success-URL, one for failure and
one cancellation-URL.

== Cross-Referencing

You can cross-reference transactions by:

- <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_CrossMerchant, Merchant account>>
- <<#GeneralPlatformFeatures_CrossPayment, Payment method>>

//-

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_CrossMerchant]
=== Merchant Referencing

It is possible to enable cross payment account references for a merchant
in _{payment-gateway}._ It means a transaction from the merchant
account A can reference another one from the merchant account B if its
processing user has access rights also to the merchant account A. This
is a typical scenario for marketplace portals where a consumer can allow
to reuse his payment instrument for the further orders without the new
authentication process (so-called one-click-payment).

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_CrossMerchant_Setup]
==== Merchant Setup

It is possible to reference a previous transaction using a different
merchant account.

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_CrossMerchant_Setup_Precondition]
.Precondition

The general rule is:

- The processing user used in the referencing transaction must have
access rights to the merchant account of the referenced transaction.
- The access rights to a particular merchant account for the given
processing user must be established on the ACL level.

//-

In order to enable the cross reference feature for a merchant account
the following global merchant parameter must be set to true:
*global.crossreference.enabled*

In order to see the cross referenced transactions in _{enterprise-portal-abbr}_, the _{enterprise-portal-abbr}_ user
must also be granted to access the data of the referenced merchant
account. If this is not the case, the cross referenced transactions are
not shown inside the payment details list. i.e. the user cannot see the
transaction data of other merchants even if their transactions are
referencing the transactions of the others. This is a default setup
situation for a merchant _{enterprise-portal-abbr}_ user.

The billing logic for the cross referenced transactions is unchanged.
The cross referenced transactions are billed for the corresponding
merchant account used in the payment request.

The merchant reconciliation report is unchanged as well. The cross
referenced transactions are reported inside the reconciliation file for
the corresponding merchant account.

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_CrossPayment]
=== Payment Methods

Cross-Payment-Methods Referencing helps to reduce fraud in recurring
payments, because the merchant can reference two payment methods.

The initial transaction has to be performed with a method that requires
access credentials from the customer.

With the referencing of two payment methods the merchant can avoid that
a SEPA Direct Debit transaction, if used as initial
transaction, is returned after he has already provided the consumer with
the purchased goods or services.

The main reasons for returned SEPA Direct Debit transaction are:

- "Bank account not existing"
- "Invalid bank data"
//-

Cross-Payment-Methods Referencing is available, when the merchant has

- several online banking payment methods configured within MAID.
- installed {payment-gateway} backend and
Payment Page integrations.
//-

Cross-Payment-Methods Referencing is executed in two steps:

- The initial transaction is placed by the customer actively via one of
the supported online banking payment methods:
* Sofort.
* iDEAL
* giropay
* eps-Überweisung
//-

If the initial transaction is successful, the bank details IBAN and BIC
are saved in the database, but not returned in the response.

NOTE: Not every bank provides bank account data. {payment-gateway}
can only process bank account data if provided by the bank.

- The subsequent transaction is a SEPA Direct Debit transaction.
The merchant receives a transaction ID from the initial transaction
which is used later to place a referenced SEPA Direct Debit transaction
without knowing the bank account details as they are automatically
connected to the transaction ID.

This functionality allows e.g. easier subscription management.

[WARNING]
====
 - All mandatory SEPA Direct Debit transaction fields must be provided in
the initial transaction so that they can be used in the subsequent SEPA
Direct Debit transaction. Mandatory SEPA fields are:
* Mandate ID,
* Mandate Signature Date
* Creditor ID
- The initial transaction must have a sequence type "first" to avoid a
SEPA Direct Debit transaction with the sequence type "recurring" to
be rejected by the system.
- The subsequent transaction requires the sequence type "recurring".
====

A clear position for the "periodic" tag cannot be established. It can be
set either <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_CrossPayment_Samples_Initial, in the initial transaction>> iDEAL
or <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_CrossPayment_Samples_Subsequent, in the subsequent transaction>> within
the SEPA Direct Debit.

The advantages, setting it in the subsequent transaction are:

- Integration of original payment method (e.g. iDEAL, Sofort., …) does
not need to be amended.
- If you are using SEPA as an additional payment option, the behavior
where to send the periodic tags is identical.
//-

NOTE: API Endpoint for referenced transactions for alternative payment methods
is always:

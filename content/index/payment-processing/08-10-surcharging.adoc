[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_Surcharging]
== Surcharging

Surcharging is a feature for <<PP, {payment-page-v1}>> image:images/icons/legacy.png[LEGACY, 80, 20, role="no-zoom", title="Development of this product is discontinued."] (HPP and EPP) and
<<RestApi, REST API>>.
Aimed at merchants who would like to charge additional fees for certain types of
payments, this feature guarantees transparency on surcharge rates for
consumers. 

NOTE: In Australia, this feature complies with the
link:https://www.rba.gov.au/payments-and-infrastructure/review-of-card-payments-regulation/q-and-a/card-payments-regulation-qa-conclusions-paper.html[RBA's surcharging standards].

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_Surcharging_Setup]
=== Merchant Account Setup

To enable this feature, <<ContactUs, contact merchant support>>.

Your account must be set up as follows:

- Your merchant account must be configured to enable surcharging.
- Your country must be defined in your merchant account.
- Surcharge rates must be configured by region, card type indicator, card type, and payment method.

//-

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_Surcharging_SurchargeAmount]
=== Surcharge Amount

The surcharge amount is the amount added to the original transaction amount (price of a good or service). It is calculated based on the respective <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_Surcharging_SurchargeRates, surcharge rates>>. Depending on the originial transaction amount, the surcharge amount varies. The sum of the surcharge amount and the original transaction amount results in the final amount payable.

NOTE: Partial Refund/Capture is not allowed for surcharge transactions. Surcharge transactions must be refunded/captured in full.

The surcharge amount can be determined in two ways:

.. Auto-calculate the surcharge amount based on the configured surcharge rates.
.. Calculate the surcharge amount yourself and include the value directly as part of the purchase request.
+
NOTE: Including the ``<surcharge-amount>`` as part of the purchase request overwrites your merchant account configuration.

//-

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_Surcharging_Workflow]
=== Workflow

Depending on how the surcharge amount is determined, the workflow varies.

.. If you decide to auto-calculate the surcharge amount based on the configured surcharge rates:
+
<<PP, {payment-page-v1}>>

- send a _purchase_ request without including a predefined surcharge amount.

+

<<RestApi, REST API>>

- send a _calculate-fee_ request and retrieve the surcharge amount from the response first, then 
- insert the retrieved value in the _purchase_ request and send the request thereafter. 
+

.. If you decide to calculate the surcharge amount yourself, include the value directly as part of the _purchase_ request (<<PP, {payment-page-v1}>> and
<<RestApi, REST API>>). 

//-

Below, we provide  <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_Surcharging_Samples_CalculateFee, _calculate-fee_>> and <<GeneralPlatformFeatures_Surcharging_Samples_Purchase, _purchase_>> samples for REST API.

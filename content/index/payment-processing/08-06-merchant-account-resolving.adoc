[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_MerchantAccountResolving]
== Merchant Account Resolving

_Merchant Account Resolving_ allows the merchant to create a transaction
without a specific Merchant Account ID (MAID) present in time of
transaction request. Instead of the MAID, a Super Merchant ID and a
Resolver Category Code is sent in the request and a _specific MAID_ used
for payment is automatically calculated by the Payment Processor Engine
during payment processing. The calculation is based on
<<GeneralPlatformFeatures_ResolvingRules, resolving rules>>.
Resolving rules define the logic for choosing the _specific MAID_.

If the merchant wants to use the Resolver feature he must get in contact
with the Merchant Support. The Merchant Support will do all the
necessary customizing.

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_ResolvingRules]
=== Resolving Rules

Resolving rules define the logic for the resolver engine. Based on these
rules a _final MAID_ is selected and used for the payment process. The
rules are logic expressions and several rules with a different priority
can be defined. The first rule that matches the conditions is
automatically processed and appropriate MAID is used. Other rules with
lower priority are ignored. These rules are configured by our Merchant
Support team based on the Merchant's specific requirements.

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_ResolverCategoryCode]
=== Resolver Category Code

_Resolver Category Code_ is a field that defines groups of several
resolving rules. This allows the merchant to define more sets of
resolving rules and lets him decide which will be used for resolving in
time of payment request. Merchant Support provides the value to merchant
when sets of rules are configured.

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_ResolvingPaymentMethods]
=== Supported Payment Methods

_Merchant Account Resolving_ is available for _Credit Card_ 
and all other alternative payment methods.

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_ResolvingSpecified]
=== Specifying Resolvers

Resolving rules for Credit Cards can be based on:

- BIN routing for 3D Secure handling (Non-3D / 3D Merchant Account ID)
- BIN routing for different fraud rule handling
- BIN routing for different acquirer handling
- Routing based on Credit Card brand
- Routing based on Amount
- Routing based on custom parameters

[#GeneralPlatformFeatures_ResolvingSuperMerchant]
=== Super Merchant

Super Merchant or Super Merchant ID is basically a group of several
MAIDs. When the merchant does not send a MAID specifically in the
request, Resolver needs to know a set of several MAIDs to choose from.
Basically it's like an Account ID superior to several MAIDs. the
Merchant Support configures Super Merchant and its inherent MAIDs.

NOTE: The payment *response* (structured payment by seamless or message POST
to merchant's page) *contains* resolved merchant and *signature computed
with secret key of resolved merchant*.

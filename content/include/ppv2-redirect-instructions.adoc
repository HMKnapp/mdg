At this point, you need to redirect your consumer to
``payment-redirect-url`` (or render it in an _iframe_ depending on your
<<PPv2, integration method>>).

Consumers are redirected to the payment form. There they enter their
data and submit the form to confirm the payment. + 
_Possible transaction results_:

- Successful (``transaction-state: success``)
- Failed (``transaction-state: failed``)
- Canceled (``transaction-state: failed``)

//-

The transaction result is the value of ``transaction-state`` in the
payment response. More details (including the status code) can also be
found in the ``statuses`` object of the payment response. Canceled
payments are returned as ``failed``, but the
``status description`` indicates it was canceled.

In any case (unless the consumer cancels the transaction on a 3^rd^ party provider page), a base64-encoded response containing payment information is sent to the configured redirection URL. See
<<PPSolutions_PPv2_ConfigureRedirects, Configuring Redirects and IPNs for {payment-page-v2-abbr}>>
for more details on redirection targets after payment and transaction status
notifications.

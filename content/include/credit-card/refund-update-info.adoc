We are updating refund transactions for credit card (Mastercard and Visa). 

With the update, the response to a refund-request returns the ``authorization-code`` as follows:


* If your refund-request is successful, the ``authorization-code`` contains a 6-digit value.
* If the issuer declines the refund-request, the ``authorization-code`` does not contain a value. Please refer to <<StatusCodes_InDetail, ``statuses.status.code``>> for more details.

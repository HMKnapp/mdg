.Table Key

The 3D Secure 2 test card tables deviate in a few instances from the <<API_CC_TestCards_3D, 3D Secure 1 tables>>.

- _3DS Method:_ This is an optional redirect URL to the ACS. It gathers additional browser information from the consumer, i.e. the device fingerprint. This happens prior to authentication to facilitate the transaction risk assessment.
- _Authentication Result:_ 3D Secure 2 includes an additional status *R* for rejected authentication.
- _Challenge:_ This column indicates whether the test card triggers an authentication challenge or not. Authentication challenges serve to provide more information about the consumer to reduce risk and fraud. No challenge allows testing of a frictionless payment flow. This is typically the case for low-value and low-risk transactions.
- _Enrollment Result:_ This is currently not present in the tables below, as the result of the *check-enrollment* is always expected to be *Y* (Card enrolled) for the test cards provided on this page.

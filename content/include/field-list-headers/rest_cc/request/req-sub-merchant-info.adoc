``sub-merchant-info`` is a child of <<{listname}_request_payment, payment>>. ``sub-merchant-info`` fields are required for the <<CreditCard_PaymentFeatures_PaymentFacilitator, Payment Facilitator>>. If you want to use ``sub-merchant-info``, all the fields in this table are mandatory for every initial step of a transaction.  We recommend to send ``sub-merchant-info`` with each transaction step during the payment process. Otherwise, some transactions cannot be completed successfully. +
``state`` is an exception. See ``state`` description for details.

``card`` is a child of  <<{listname}_request_payment, payment>>. ``card`` details are sent only in the first transaction request when the card is used for the first time. Due to <<CreditCard_PaymentFeatures_Tokenization_Introduction, PCI DSS>> compliance, ``card`` details are immediately replaced by a token. Beginning with the first response, this token is used for every consecutive transaction (request and response) that is performed
with this credit card. Token data is provided with the <<{listname}_request_cardtoken, card-token>> element. +

NOTE: Only the transaction type _detokenize_ returns ``expiration-month``, ``expiration-year`` and ``card-type`` in a response. All the other transaction types return elements of ``card-token`` in the response.

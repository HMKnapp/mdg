``card`` is a child of  <<{listname}_request_payment, payment>>. ``card`` details are sent only in the first transaction request when the card is used for the first time. Due to <<CreditCard_PaymentFeatures_Tokenization_Introduction, PCI DSS>> compliance, ``card`` details are immediately replaced by a token. Beginning with the first response, this token is used for every consecutive transaction (request and response) that is performed with this credit card. Token data is provided with the <<CC_Fields_xmlelements_request_cardtoken, card-token>> element. +

// This include file requires the shortcut {listname} in the link, as this include file is used in different environments.
// The shortcut guarantees that the target of the link remains in the current environment.

``browser`` is a child of <<{listname}_request_payment, payment>>.

[NOTE]
====
* For all the optional fields (except ``time-zone``), {payment-provider-name}'s MPI automatically detects this and adds this field to your request.
* We strongly recommend sending *all* optional ``browser`` fields. If you do, it is less likely that the issuer authenticates the consumer with a <<CreditCard_PSD2_SCA, Strong Customer Authentication>>.

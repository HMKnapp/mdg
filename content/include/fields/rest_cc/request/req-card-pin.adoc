A PIN pad or PIN entry
device is an electronic device used in a debit, credit or smart card-based
transaction to accept and encrypt the cardholder's personal identification
number (PIN). PIN pads are normally used with payment terminals, automated
teller machines or integrated point of sale devices in which an electronic
cash register is responsible for taking the sale amount and initiating/handling
the transaction. The PIN pad is required to read the card and allow the PIN to
be securely entered and encrypted before it is sent to the bank.
